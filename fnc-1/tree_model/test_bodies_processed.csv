1,"Gunshots rang out on Black Friday inside a packed Washington state mall, injuring one person as hundreds of other shoppers hid inside stores

TACOMA, Wash. -- Inside a packed Washington state mall gunshots rang out on Black Friday, injuring one person as hundreds of other shoppers hid inside stores.

Authorities said the shooting in Tacoma, south of Seattle, was reported just after 7 p.m. on Friday near the mall’s food court. The person shot was taken to a hospital with serious injuries, Tacoma police said. It's unclear what condition the injured person was in as of Saturday.

As of Saturday morning, there have been no reported arrests.

KOMO reports that officers working in the mall saw a small group get into a dispute that escalated with gunfire. The suspects fled the mall.

After the shots rang out at Tacoma Mall, which immediately went into lockdown, shoppers sheltered in place or hid inside stores.

“We were about to get up and I hear about six shots or something,” Daisey Dockter, who was finishing a meal with her aunt and uncle when gunfire broke out, told KOMO. “We all just start running toward the door. It’s a huge mob of people. Everyone’s kind of pushing.”

At least two uniformed officers were at a table in the food court when the shooting began and both rushed to respond.

In addition, more than 60 law enforcement officers from Tacoma, Pierce County, Lakewood, Puyallup and the Washington State Patrol responded.

Pierce County Sheriff’s Sgt. Darren Moss said police went in to conduct a “coordinated search” of the mall.

Fredrick Hoskins was shopping with his daughter when he heard gunfire.

“There was a boom, boom, boom … boom, boom, boom. Maybe like six shots,” Hoskins, who previously served in the military, told The News Tribune. “It sounded like a revolver, and it sounded like one shooter.”

The Tacoma Mall is the city’s largest shopping mall, with more than 100 stores."
2,"(CNN) A 5-year-old in Brooklyn, Park, Minnesota, was shot and killed on Thanksgiving by a 13-year-old who accidentally fired a gun while a group of kids were making a video for social media, according to local police.

Brooklyn Park Police responded to a home on Florida Avenue around 10:20 p.m. Thursday in response to reports of a child who had been shot, police said in a statement on Facebook Friday

Officers ""attempted to render first aid; however, the child died at the scene,"" police said.

Police determined through a preliminary investigation that a 13-year-old boy was ""handling a gun"" inside the home, police said. ""Several other juveniles were present as they were attempting to make a social media video.""

It remains unclear exactly what circumstances led up to the shooting, but at some point the teen ""shot the gun striking the 5-year-old,"" police said, adding investigators believe the shooting was accidental.

3,"As a boy growing up in what was then Norfolk County, Gerald Kinney played “Army” with his friends.

Kinney’s family came to own a forested plot of land off of Jolliff Road in the 1950s and Kinney and his friends pretended to trade gunfire and run up ramparts on earthen walls that seemed to naturally surround the spot.

What Kinney didn’t know then? The spot had once been a Civil War fort.

Union soldiers set up along what was a major transportation route to keep the rebel army from heading farther into the region. The fort might have been constructed by the Confederates before then.

“There was always the rumor” about the fort being used during the war, said Kinney, now 70. “The fort was always near to my heart.”

The city of Chesapeake now hopes to preserve the little-known earthworks fort in Western Branch by turning it into a public park, complete with historical markers and walking trails.

The City Council recently authorized officials to enter an agreement with the state transportation department to conduct historical and environmental reviews for what they call the Civil War Fort Park Project. VDOT took over the land while constructing Interstate 664 a few decades ago.

Local Civil War buffs, meanwhile, are working to uncover anything about the unnamed fort they can find.

—

On a recent crisp fall afternoon, Mike Barber pulled off Jolliff Road next to a densely forested area.

Barber is director of the city’s Park, Recreation and Tourism department and leads the charge for the park. He made his way along an unofficial path, leaves crunching underfoot, until the fort came into view — a rectangle that stretches a total perimeter of about 900 feet.

Its dirt walls are a few feet high with gaps for entrances and cannon platforms. In the center is a circular earthen structure about the size of a large kiddie pool with knee-high walls. That may have been a magazine where ammunition was stored, said Jessica Cosmas, the parks department’s director of a new historical services division. All of it has eroded a bit over time.

Story continues

Earthwork fortifications were made with materials at hand and designed for temporary use, according to the National Park Service website: “Dirt is a very inexpensive resource, and when used in massive amounts it is the basis for a very strong and intimidating structure.”

The five acres now owned by VDOT are off-limits to the public. But Barber said discarded beer cans and tire tracks from all-terrain vehicles show the area is still being used.

The walls of the fort are great for bikers looking for small hills, he noted, but that’s a problem for preserving the site. He hopes the city can get the land from VDOT as soon as possible and start taking care of it.

The process may take a while. The environmental review will take 6-8 months, including historic work as the fort is eligible for the Register of Historic Places, VDOT spokesperson Jordan-Ashley Walker said in an email. Then the department can do its property management review, which can take up to a year.

VDOT could not say when it acquired the property or from whom. Walker said that information will be determined when doing a title search, which the city will have to provide.

The site first came to the city’s attention about five years ago, Barber said, when officials were contacted by members of the Hampton Roads Civil War Roundtable, an informal group of dozens of local historians. After various conversations and additional mapping of the site — including lidar, or laser sensing, technology that showed a clear outline of a fort from above — officials started discussing a park project.

“Our vision grew to where it could be another stop on the Civil War Trails tour,” Barber said.

Planning is still in conceptual stages until the land can be acquired, though.

—

Kinney’s family ended up with the land, including the fort in the 1950s, before VDOT took it to construct the nearby interstate.

His grandmother leased surrounding fields to farmers who grew soybeans, corn and sweet potatoes.

He didn’t think much of the history as a child. But after serving for two decades in the Air Force, Kinney returned to Hampton Roads and became more interested. A little over a decade ago, he and his family dived into the site’s history. He was facilities manager of the Mariners’ Museum & Park in Newport News at the time and was allowed some of their resources for the personal project, he said.

He then wrote a detailed report, “Mystery Fort” — explaining what they found. The report includes photos of artifacts discovered over the past century, most of which were passed down or given to his family, such as bullets, strap hooks, an ordnance fragment and buttons from a New York regiment of the Union Army.

What’s now Jolliff Road — often referred to as Stage Road — was one of two main routes that led from central Virginia to North Carolina, said Herb Harrell of the Hampton Roads Civil War Roundtable.

The location, therefore, would’ve been strategic to monitor who was coming and going — especially toward the important Norfolk Naval Shipyard, said Ed Carbaugh, another member of the roundtable. It was also along an important waterway — Goose Creek — that feeds into the Western Branch of the Elizabeth River.

The dense tree canopy at the site wasn’t there in the 19th century, when it had been cleared for farming, he said.

“It was just out there in the open,” Carbaugh said. “It would’ve been highly visible in two strategic directions.”

The fort likely was the biggest in a series that formed a picket line, the roundtable believes. Up to 50 Union soldiers would be stationed there at a time, camping in the space between the walls and central magazine.

Cannons around the edges weren’t fixed like at a major fort, Harrell said. They were on big wheels, rolled over to whichever side they were needed.

“You didn’t know when the rebels were gonna come out of the swamp or try to force their way across the bridge,” Harrell said.

At night, in fact, guards at the fort would take the boards off the nearby bridge so an attacking force could not cross it, he said.

The fort is referenced many times in regimental histories, especially in 1862 and ‘63, but never named. There were no battles there, though the ordnance fragment found may suggest a skirmish.

It’s unclear exactly who built the earthworks fort.

The Union took control of Norfolk in 1862, forcing the Confederates to evacuate posts around the area. Records indicate the Confederates had a position in 1861 near the fort, Harrell said. He believes it was built by Confederate soldiers but taken over by the Union soon afterward.

Like much about the site, the origin remains a mystery.

But Harrell said it’s amazing the original structure is so well preserved. “The minute I saw the fort, it blew my mind,” he said.

It’d be a “history teacher’s dream” to teach from an eventual public park, not only about the fort’s role but other histories that likely happened there, he said. That includes enslaved people seeking freedom after coming through the Great Dismal Swamp just to the south, military happenings during the American Revolution and Indigenous history long before any of it.

“There are so many stories that have gone untold about our history and how we’ve gotten to this point,” said Barber, the parks director. “This just gives us another piece of the puzzle that can really tell the story of Chesapeake.”

4,"A CTA bus driver was stabbed Friday night when he confronted a man he saw pickpocket a woman on an eastbound North Avenue bus in the Lincoln Park area, police said.

About 9:20 p.m., the 37-year-old driver saw a man on the bus pickpocket a woman while in the 300 block of West North Avenue in the city’s Old Town Triangle neighborhood, police said.

When the driver confronted the alleged pickpocket, they begn arguing, which leld to a brawl, police said.

The suspect pulled out a knife and swung it, stabbing the bus driver in the hand before fleeing the scene. He was caught and arrested shortly after that, according to police.

5,"Some FedEx packages in Alabama will absolutely, positively not be delivered on time.

Between 300 and 400 FedEx packages were found Wednesday in a wooded ravine near the small town of Hayden in northcentral Alabama, the Blount County Sheriff's Office said on its Facebook page.

Deputies guarded the packages at the scene, which is about 30 miles north of Birmingham, until FedEx workers arrived to pick up the packages, Sheriff Mark Moon told The Associated Press. FedEx sent several trucks and drivers from across the South to retrieve the packages, he said.

Photos posted on the sheriff’s office's Facebook page showed workers on Thanksgiving Day retrieving packages that had been tossed towards the bottom of a wooded hillside.

The sheriff's office is continuing to investigate why the packages were tossed into the ravine, but did not respond to a request for an update Saturday.

Nearby resident Natasha Abney told Birmingham ABC affiliate station WBMA-TV that her neighbor found the boxes on his property. “I mean it was just a river of boxes,” she said. “Some busted open, some not.”

In addition to recovering and delivering the packages, FedEx is working with law enforcement on the investigation, the company said in a statement.

“The security of our customers’ shipments is a top priority and we are committed to treating our customers’ packages with the utmost care,” FedEx said in a statement Friday. ""We are conducting a review of this situation and will take the appropriate action.”

FedEx directed customers with questions about their shipments to track them on the FedEx website.

7,"The nation's leading infectious disease expert says the strain has not yet been detected in the U.S.

Dr. Fauci 'Would Not Be Surprised' if Omicron COVID Variant Is Already in the United States

The Omicron COVID-19 variant could already be in the United States, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci.

""I would not be surprised if it is,"" Fauci, 80, told Peter Alexander and Kristen Welker Saturday on Weekend Today.

Get push notifications with news, features and more.

Fauci said the strain — currently known as B.1.1.529 — ""has a large number of mutations"" particularly affecting the virus' ability to bind to cells in the nose and lung.

""We have not detected it yet [in the U.S.],"" he added, ""but when you have a virus that is showing this degree of transmissibility and you're already having travel-related cases that they've noted in Israel and Belgium and in other places — when you have a virus like this, it almost invariably is ultimately going to go essentially all over.""

Based on mutations identified by researchers, Fauci said the strain ""likely will be more transmissible"" than others, including the highly transmissible Delta variant. ""We don't know that yet,"" he noted in the interview, ""but you have to assume that would be the case.""

Fauci also raised concern over whether the new variant ""could evade the protection"" of key treatments such as monoclonal antibodies and convalescent plasma for those who have contracted and recovered from COVID-19 — ""and possibly vaccine(s).""

""These are all maybes, but the suggestion is enough,"" Fauci shared.

The Omicron variant has spread rapidly through South Africa after it was first discovered in Botswana. The strain, which has now made its way to Europe, prompted a World Health Organization panel meeting on Friday, where the variant received its name and was classified as a highly transmissible ""variant of concern.""

In response, President Joe Biden announced that travelers from eight South African countries will be prohibited from entering the U.S. beginning Monday.

On Weekend Today, Fauci emphasized the importance of getting ahead of the virus while possible, which he said is why the country is already taking precautions.

""Even though the numbers are relatively small, its ability to infect people who have recovered from infection and even people who have been vaccinated make us say, 'This is something you've got to pay really close attention to and be prepared for something that's serious,'"" the nation's leading infectious disease expert explained.

Blocking travel from countries with reported cases, Fauci added, allows experts more time to assess the situation. ""The issue of blocking travel from a given country is to just give us time to assess it better,"" he noted.

Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.

In the meantime, the chief medical advisor to President Biden urged Americans to get vaccinated against the deadly virus and not let their guard down in ""congregate settings"" where the virus can be increasingly transmissible.

According to Weekend Today, cases of COVID-19 are up at least 10% over the last two weeks in at least 15 states, largely in the Eastern portion of the country. More than 100,000 cases are being reported each day.

Fauci also said the country's fate ""is in our own hands,"" adding that the Omicron variant ""is yet again another reason"" for Americans to protect themselves against COVID-19.

""It is absolutely essential that unvaccinated people get vaccinated and the vaccinated people get boosters,"" urged Fauci. ""We know now clearly that when you get a booster shot ... you dramatically increase the level of protection [you have]."""
8,"A security guard has died after he was shot while protecting a San Francisco Bay Area television news crew

OAKLAND, Calif. -- A security guard has died after he was shot while he protected a San Francisco Bay Area television news crew covering a smash-and-grab theft, part of a rash of organized retail crime in the region.

“We are devastated by the loss of security guard and our friend, Kevin Nishita. Our deepest sympathy goes to Kevin’s wife, his children, his family, and to all his friends and colleagues,” KRON-TV's vice president and general manager, Jim Rose, said in a statement issued Saturday.

The former police officer was an armed guard for Star Protection Agency and provided security for many reporters in the region.

He was shot in the abdomen during an attempted robbery of KRON-TV's camera equipment near downtown Oakland on Wednesday, police said.

The news crew was covering a recent robbery where a group of thieves broke in and stole from a clothing store.

A reward of $32,500 is being offered for information that leads to an arrest in Nishita's killing.

“This senseless loss of life is due to yet another violent criminal act in the Bay Area. We hope that offering a reward will help lead to the arrest of those responsible so they can face justice for this terrible tragedy,” Rose said.

The region has been struck by organized retail thefts in which bands of thieves, some carrying crowbars and hammers, break into high-end stores and snatch merchandise.

Similar thefts were reported in Los Angeles and Beverly Hills.

At least eight thieves stormed a Home Depot store in Lakewood on Black Friday and grabbed hammers, crowbars and sledgehammers in the tool section before dashing off in a getaway vehicle, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said.

The thefts are believed to be part of sophisticated criminal networks that recruit people to steal merchandise in stores throughout the country and then sell it online. Experts and law enforcement officials say the thefts are ratcheting up as the holiday shopping season gets underway."

According to a new report from Angel Investment Network, confidence has strongly returned to the startup ecosystem in the U.S. and in the U.K. 18 months since the start of the pandemic: roughly three-quarters of startups say they’re now confident about the next year. The report surveyed the views of startups in the U.S. and U.K. to see how they have responded more than a year and a half after the pandemic first hit.

This shift in confidence levels represents a remarkable turnaround and highlights the strangeness of the period we’re now emerging from. It’s particularly underscored by the fact that 62% of U.S. startups and 59% of U.K. startups reported seeing business growth negatively impacted. Of those who had been raising funds before the pandemic, close to one in two saw investors pull out.

The resilience and adaptability of startups are particularly exhibited through the sensible strategies adopted in both countries, including a stronger focus on networking, bootstrapping, and holding off on launch plans.

However, while activity is solidly re-emerging, the report also analyzes what can help create a better startup ecosystem in the future. Raising investment remains the biggest challenge, according to 85% of all startups surveyed. There is also a firm belief in both countries that governments can continue to play a key role going forward, principally through tax relief to encourage further angel investment — the lifeblood of early-stage funding.

Furthermore, the report identified the biggest bugbears for startup founders. The top issue in both countries was investors demanding too much of a stake in the business. Time-consuming due diligence was also a pressing concern, as were very slow rejections.

The crash was reported at 6:30 a.m. on U.S. Highway 160 in Wellington, KWCH-TV reported. A 2015 Dodge Challenger was traveling east on the inside lane when it hit a man who was running from north to south.

The Highway Patrol identified the man who was killed as Chuck E. Flynn of Wellington.

The driver and two passengers in the car were not seriously injured.

A group of between 20 to 30 people robbed a Best Buy Burnsville, Minn., on Black Friday, stealing an unknown amount of merchandise.

CBS 4, a local CBS affiliate reported that the group overtook the Best Buy around 8 p.m., according to law enforcement, stealing electronics and other store merchandise. The suspects fled before police arrived.

Police said no one was injured during the robbery and no weapons were found at the scene.

Also on Friday, police said a smaller mob broke into another Best Buy in a mall nearby Burnsville.

The Hill has reached out to the Burnsville Police Department for more information.

The crime follows a recent trend of ""smash-and-grab"" style burglaries across the country. Organized groups arrive at stores, break in and steal merchandise before fleeing in getaway cars.

An Apple store and a Nordstrom were robbed on Wednesday in California. The robbers stole about eight expensive purses at the clothing retail store and the Apple store suffered about $20,000 in product losses.

The Best Buy groups ransacked the store while it was still open, unlike many instances of smash-and-grab robberies where the suspects ransack the store after hours. The Best Buy in Burnsville closes at around 10 p.m., according to its website.

CEO of Best Buy, Corie Barry, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" her employees were traumatized by the crimes.

""What I would really stress here is, for our employees, these are really traumatic experiences,"" she said. ""Obviously, their safety is our first priority."""

Some of the best Black Friday deals are on student laptops, work laptops, and gaming laptops. HP has them all, and we’ve pulled our favorites below.

There’s a big shortage in consumer electronics this year because of a decline in microchip production. Black Friday laptop deals are one of the most popular sales categories, but they rely heavily on microchips. If you see a deal you like, you should jump on it quickly. These things are selling like hotcakes, and if you wait too long, you could miss out.

Editor’s Note: Black Friday is soon drawing to a close and the best deals — like the ones below — are in short supply, so act now or risk missing out.

HP 11-inch Chromebook — $150, was $260

Why buy:

Very affordable

Powerful for its price range

Chromebooks are perfect for students. They’re compact, easy to use, and cheap. HP’s best Black Friday Chromebook deals check all the boxes. This Chromebook runs on Chrome OS, and anyone who uses Google Docs and Gmail will fall in love with how naturally their files and programs will integrate into the Chromebook setup. It has a modest processor and graphics card, but 4GB of RAM. It’s certainly not a gaming laptop, but it’s comparable to most casual-use laptops. You’ll be able to run several apps at once without experiencing any slowdowns. It’s perfect for people who manage big projects, or just want to listen to Spotify while they update their Excel sheets.

The screen is 11.6 inches diagonally. That’s smaller than your average laptop, but big enough to display movies and documents without getting claustrophobic. It uses a 1366 x 768 resolution, which might not sound like much, but the compact size of the laptop means the density of the pixels is enough to make streamed movies and shows look nice, and text will be clear and crisp. It comes with a webcam and internal speakers, which not every Chromebook has.

This Chromebook uses Wi-Fi — there’s no Ethernet port. But you do get a microSD reader, multiple USB ports and a USB-C power supply port. It’s designed to be used on the go, in cafes and lecture halls. To that end, it has an impressive 13 hours of battery life. That’s the power of an undemanding operating system in a sleek package.

HP 15-inch Laptop — $375, was $600

Why buy:

Thin and light

Very affordable

Big screen and keyboard

Comes with Windows 11

Need a new laptop that’s fully upgraded for 2022? This HP 15-inch laptop comes with Windows 11, so it’s completely up to date. It’s a modestly priced laptop that will work great for students, home office professionals, and casual users alike. Power-wise, it has an 11th-gen Intel Core i5 processor, which is a decent processor capable of running any common application. It comes with 8GB of RAM initially, but you can customize it to get 12 or 16 for a bit more cash. The base 8GB will let you run a couple of small programs or one hefty program at once without a slowdown. You get 256GB of storage, which is plenty if you mostly save images and documents. You’ll want to get an external hard drive if you edit movies, music, or photos, though.

The screen is 15.6 inches diagonally, so it’s a bit on the large side for your average laptop. That kind of space will make movies and shows look great, and you’ll have room to run multiple windows at once without constantly switching between them. Having that big of a screen allows the keyboard to be large too, so you get a full numeric keypad next to the QWERTY keys. The bezels are fairly small on the sides, but get thicker on the top to make room for the HD webcam. It measures 0.78 inches thick when closed, and weighs in at just under 4 pounds — nice and light for carrying with you. If you need a good laptop for work or school that’s modestly priced, this is a fantastic option.

HP Pavilion x360 15-inch Convertible w/ touchscreen — $530, was $750

Why buy:

Convertible mode makes it a tablet and a laptop

Touchscreen mode in both configurations

Thin and light

Very affordable during Black Friday

The Pavilion is one of HP’s staple laptop lines. It’s a great laptop with some fantastic features. But by far the most unique aspect of the HP Pavilion x360 is its 2-in-1 capability. You can flip the laptop a full 360 degrees around its hinges to make it a tablet. The computer has a full touchscreen that can be used in both the laptop and tablet modes. You can also flip the computer into an easel shape by propping it up on its screen and keyboard. That mode is perfect for writing or drawing with a stylus, or watching movies.

Power-wise the HP Pavilion x360 comes with an 11th-gen Intel Core i5 processor, a standard mid-range processor for laptops. It has an Intel Iris Xe graphics card, good for any standard programs or operations. The base model has 8GB of RAM, which is also standard for laptops primarily used for school, work, or casual browsing. If you need something more powerful, say for editing videos or exporting large files, you have options to upgrade. HP gives you the option to enhance any aspect of the Pavilion x360 and still get the Black Friday deal.

The screen is the Pavilion standard of 15.6 inches diagonally, which means you get space for a full keyboard and number pad. It measures in at less than an inch thick when closed. That’s a great size for a laptop, but it will of course be clunkier than a tablet when you flip it around. Despite being two different devices simultaneously, it still weighs less than 4 pounds.

HP Pavilion Gaming Laptop — $600, was $800

Why buy:

Built for gaming

Easily customizable

HD screen

Wide keyboard with number pad

While this laptop shares the same Pavilion name, it’s radically different than its traditional laptop counterparts because it’s optimized to run high-end games. Instead of an Intel processor, the HP Pavilion Gaming Laptop uses an AMD Ryzen 5, much better suited to performance. The graphics card also pivots from Intel to bring you the king of gaming graphics card brands, NVIDIA. This Pavilion has an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650, an excellent mid-range card. It comes standard with 8GB of RAM, which isn’t ideal for multitasking, but should be plenty for more modest tasks. Of course, you can upgrade the processor, graphics card, and RAM for a bit more money, while still keeping the initial Black Friday discount. If Black Friday gaming laptop deals are your top priority, this is a good option.

HP even switched up the bodywork on this machine. The chassis is more stylish, with harsher angles. The keyboard has a full numeric keypad, and you have the option of upgrading to a backlit keyboard in white or green. Of course, we can’t forget the screen, a vital component of any gaming setup. All models have a 15.6-inch display, the standard for the Pavilion, with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 and anti-glare coating. Basically, anything under 2K is going to look good on this setup. The gaming laptop comes with Windows 11, so it’s fully upgraded and ready to tackle 2022. Some nice bonuses are the HDMI port for using an external monitor, an Ethernet port for faster web connections, and a USB-C port for fast file transfers.

HP Pavilion x360 15-inch Convertible — $800, was $970

Why buy:

Significantly more power than a standard HP Pavilion

2-in-1 capabilities

Quick charging time

Relatively light for its power

This is the big sibling of the other Convertible HP Pavilion x360, one of the best 2-in-1 laptops out there. It looks exactly the same, and has the same convenient 2-in-1 abilities, but it’s much more powerful. Instead of an Intel i5 processor, this version has the i7, which is much better suited to multitasking and heavy duty tasks like video editing. It comes with 16GB of RAM as standard, which is double that of its little sibling, although it keeps the same Intel Iris Xe graphics card. Put together, that’s leaps and bounds more power — well suited for a creative professional.

If you’re looking for a laptop that can export large, detailed files like movies or heavily edited photos, this is your machine. The power does the heavy lifting, but the convertible nature of a 2-in-1 is what you’ll really love. When using the pen, you have a whole new world of drawing and editing opened up to you. Flip it into tablet or easel mode and you’ve got yourself a miniature art studio. When it comes time to export your creations, the processor and extra RAM will have your back.

If you like doing your work at coffee shops or outside, the Pavilion x360 can help. It has about seven hours of battery life when in use, and more if you’re only streaming video. It charges quickly — 45 minutes gets you back to 50%. HP also didn’t sacrifice too much weight when it beefed this thing up, as it weighs in at just barely over 4 pounds. When you need to export what you have, you can use an external drive or the built-in microSD slot. This is a creator’s powerhouse.

Should you shop these HP laptop Black Friday deals or wait until Cyber Monday?

Black Friday isn’t the only day of deals this November — there’s also Cyber Monday a couple days later. That might make you wonder whether it’s better to hold fire and see if you can score an even deeper discount on Cyber Monday.

The problem with doing that is that there’s no guarantee you’ll get a better deal than what you’d get on Black Friday — or even that the Black Friday deals are still hanging around. Especially since this year we’re going through a global chip shortage, waiting until Cyber Monday could mean the HP laptop you’ve had your eyes on sells out before you can grab one.

If you do decide to buy an HP laptop on Black Friday and then see an even better deal come Cyber Monday, you can always return it to get your money back, then spring for the Cyber Monday deal if it delivers in time for the holidays. But we still think the best option is to stick to Black Friday deals — they’re usually the best you can find, and waiting around could mean you miss out.

17,"Crime Police chief: 3 shot in fight at North Carolina mall A bystander described “mass hysteria” on one of the busiest shopping days of the year as shoppers ducked into stores for cover or ran for the exits. Emergency vehicles congregate around the entrance to Belk at Southpoint Mall in Durham, North Carolina, after three people, including a 10-year-old, were wounded in an afternoon shooting on Black Friday, Nov. 26, 2021. Scott Sharpe/The News & Observer via AP





DURHAM, N.C. (AP) — Three people were shot and wounded Friday during an apparent fight between two groups at a North Carolina mall crowded with shoppers on the day after Thanksgiving, the police chief said.

Authorities said in the late afternoon that one person was detained and there was no further threat to the public. A bystander described “mass hysteria” on one of the busiest shopping days of the year as shoppers ducked into stores for cover or ran for the exits.

Durham Police Chief Patrice Andrews told reporters the shooting happened around 3:20 p.m. inside The Streets at Southpoint mall during a fight between two groups who knew each other. She said one of the victims was a 10-year-old child hit when a bullet ricocheted. Police said the child’s wound did not appear life-threatening. Police did not immediately release further information on the conditions of the other two who were shot.

Andrews said another three people were injured as shoppers rushed for exits following the shooting. In a news release, police said their injuries were not life-threatening.

She said those involved in the fight that led to the shooting fled, but she vowed more arrests. She said there was no further threat to the public.

“This is not a situation where someone came into the mall and indiscriminately began firing,” Andrews said.

WRAL-TV showed traffic snarled around the mall for more than an hour after the shooting, with lines of cars trying to exit the parking lot, and numerous police cars with lights flashing outside a department store.

Shoppers described a chaotic scene after the shots echoed through the mall, with some people taking cover in stores and others rushing for the exits.

Angela Lloyd had gone to Southpoint with family members to start her Christmas shopping. She said she was walking out of a store when the chaos erupted.

“I just hear shots firing, and as soon as that happened, everybody just kind of turned around and started running and screaming,” she said in a phone interview. “Some people were running into stores, some people were almost crawling into stores. Just like mass hysteria.”

She took cover in a store herself, and she and others were directed to the dressing rooms in the back. One customer played a police scanner on his cellphone and kept people updated on what he heard, she said.

Her husband, Craig Lloyd, had just left the mall and was heading home to the town of Efland about 20 miles (33 kilometers) away when his wife called him from the dressing room.

“She said ‘There’s gunshots. They’ve got us locked in the store,’” Craig Lloyd said in a phone interview. “I turned around and went back to the mall.”

When he got back to the shopping center, Craig Lloyd said he observed a chaotic scene with some exiting the mall with their hands up and others like him trying to find loved ones. His wife was allowed to leave the mall more than an hour later.

21,"OAKLAND — A security guard who was shot during an attempted robbery while accompanying a KRON-TV Channel 4 news crew has died from injuries, authorities said.

The news station identified the guard as Kevin Nishita, a former police officer who had been working for security company Star Protection Agency.

Oakland police are investigating the shooting that led to the guard’s death.

A reward of $32,500 has been offered to anyone with information on the shooting, police said. The department, along with KRON4, its parent company Nexstar Media Inc. and Star Protection Agency all made contributions to the reward amount.

22,"As two cases of the new Omricon variant of the COVID-19 virus have been detected in the U.K., the country has mandated a return to mask wearing and PCR tests.

Addressing a nationally televised press conference on Saturday afternoon, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that face coverings will become mandatory again in shops and on public transport across England. The devolved administrations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are expected to follow suit.

“On face coverings, what we’re looking at is retail and transport, and just getting back to a position where you have to wear them in in retail settings or on our public transport,” Johnson said.

It is not immediately clear if masks are required in cultural venues like cinemas and theaters, but the U.K. health department is due to clarify that imminently.

In addition, inbound international travellers to the U.K. are required to get a PCR test by the second day of their arrival and must self-isolate until the results arrive. Those who test positive must quarantine for ten days regardless of their vaccination status.

“We’re not going to stop people travelling, I want to stress that, we’re not going to stop people travelling, but we will require anyone who enters the U.K. to take a PCR test by the end of the second day after their arrival and to self-isolate until they have a negative result,” Johnson said. “We need to slow down the spread of this variant here in the U.K., because measures at the border can only ever minimise and delay the arrival of a new variant rather than stop it all together.

The Prime Minister also said that plans for the booster jab for vaccines, for those who are double vaccinated, will be stepped up.

“We don’t yet exactly know how effective our vaccines will be against Omicron but we have good reasons for believing they will provide at least some measure of protection,” Johnson said.

“If you’re boosted, your response is likely to be stronger so it’s more vital than ever that people get their jabs and we get those boosters into arms as fast as possible.”

There are plans for six million jabs in the next three weeks. The U.K.’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation is looking at administering boosters to a wider age group and reducing the gap between the second dose and booster, which is currently six months.

The new variant, with the scientific name B.1.1.529, was first detected in South Africa and has been found in the U.K. at Nottingham and Brentwood.

South Africa, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Angola, Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia are on the U.K.’s travel red list, meaning that arrivals must quarantine for 10 days and undergo PCR tests."

24,"The latest Mega Millions jackpot has grown following the Tuesday night lottery drawing, which did not result in a winner for the $94 million grand prize.

The winning Mega Millions numbers drawn on Friday, Nov. 26 were 7, 27, 37, 42, 9, with a gold Mega Ball of 2. The Megaplier was 2X.

Watch the winning lottery numbers being pulled below.

Since there were no grand prize winners for the Friday night drawing worth an estimated $94 million with a cash option of $67.5 million, the jackpot went unclaimed.

However, one player managed to become an instant millionaire after the latest lottery drawing. A player from Michigan hit the Match 5 with the 2X Megaplier, winning $2 million.

The next Mega Millions drawing will be worth an estimated $102 million with a cash option of $73.3 million. The numbers will be drawn on Tuesday, Nov. 30.

Aside from the lone instant millionaire from the night, there were several other smaller wins. There were nine Match 4 plus gold Mega Ball winners that snagged $10,000 each.

Meanwhile, only three players match four numbers with the gold Mega Ball and 2X Megaplier, winning a $20,000 prize. The other Mega Millions wins from the night ranged between $2 and $1,000.

Lottery winners have the option to receive their winnings through a one-time lump sum payment or an annuity. Those who chose the annuity receive one immediate payment that is followed by 29 annual payments that increase by 5% each year.

Mega Millions can be played in 45 states as well as the U.S. Virgin Islands and the District of Columbia.

""The recent actions of Lt. Patterson do not align with the mission of the Madison Police Department,"" the department said in a statement.

The department had prepared to fire Patterson, a 15-year veteran of the department. Patterson apologized for the incident when he resigned.

26,"Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and other Democrats acknowledge that a significant part of the challenge facing their party is structural: With slim congressional majorities, the party cannot pass anything unless the entire caucus agrees. That empowers moderate Democrats like Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia to block some of the biggest promises to their supporters, including a broad voting rights bill.

A more aggressive approach may not lead to eventual passage of an immigration or voting rights law, but it would signal to Democrats that Mr. Biden is fighting for them, said Faiz Shakir, a close adviser to Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Mr. Shakir and others worry that the focus on the two significant pieces of legislation — infrastructure and the spending bill — won’t be enough to energize supporters skeptical of the federal government’s ability to improve their lives.

“I’m a supporter of Biden, a supporter of the agenda, and I’m frustrated and upset with him to allow this to go in the direction it has,” said Mr. Shakir, who managed Mr. Sanders’s presidential run in 2020. “It looks like we have President Manchin instead of President Biden in this debate.”

He added: “It’s made the president look weak.”

The divide over how much attention to devote to staunch Democratic constituencies versus moderate swing voters taps into a political debate that’s long roiled the party: Is it more important to energize the base or to persuade swing voters? And can Democrats do both things at once?

White House advisers argue that winning swing voters, particularly the suburban independents who play an outsize role in battleground districts, is what will keep Democrats in power — or at least curb the scale of their midterm losses. They see the drop among core groups of Democrats as reflective of a challenging political moment — rising inflation, the continued pandemic, uncertainty about schools — rather than unhappiness with the administration’s priorities.

“It’s November of 2021, not September of 2022,” John Anzalone, Mr. Biden’s pollster, said. “If we pass Build Back Better, we have a great message going into the midterms, when the bell rings on Labor Day, about what we’ve done for people.”

Even pared back from the $3.5 trillion plan that Mr. Biden originally sought, the legislation that passed the House earlier this month offers proposals transforming child care, elder care, prescription drugs and financial aid for college, as well as making the largest investment ever to slow climate change. But some of the most popular policies will not be felt by voters until long after the midterm elections, nor will the impact of many of the infrastructure projects."
27,"SAN VIGILIO DI MAREBBE, Italy (AP) — After nearly two years of being restricted to watching snow accumulate on distant mountains, Italian skiers are finally returning to the slopes that have been off-limits since the first pandemic lockdown in March 2020.

But just as the industry is poised to start its recovery from the lost season and the abrupt closure the previous year, a spike in cases in the Alpine province bordering Austria is underlining just how precarious the situation remains.

As if on cue, snow fell overnight into Saturday, blanketing the slopes of Plan de Corones in the South Tyrolean town of San Vigilio di Marebbe, giving a fresh covering to the man-made base just in time for opening day Saturday. Skiers came from as far away as Croatia and the Italian capital, Rome, as well as from neighboring valleys where slopes have yet to open.

“I have shivers up and down my spine, because we left the slopes on the famous March 8 of 2020, rushing to Rome because everything was going into lockdown,” said Monica Meloni, 53, from Rome, as snow continued to fall. “We did the last run on this slope, looking at each other and asking ourselves, 'When can we get back?' It took nearly two years.""

Her companion, Massimo Vela, said he was optimistic that the season would continue unabated.

“We hope it goes well not just for us tourists, but for all the workers in the Alpine region. This is a very important industry,'' he said.

To ensure the safety of skiers, the Dolomoti Superski network of 16 ski resorts, with 1,200 kilometers (nearly 750 miles) of runs in the Trentino-Alto Adige and Veneto regions, including Plan de Corones, have launched a special ski pass. It is integrated with the nation's health pass and is aimed at ensuring access to closed lifts only to those who are vaccinated, recently recovered from COVID-19 or have a recent negative test.

The health pass data must be verified in order to purchase a ski pass, a system that was approved by Italy’s privacy regulator, and which spares lift operators from having to check health passes each time skiers board lifts.

Skiers also are required to wear protective masks on lifts, both open chair lifts and closed gondolas, as well as a maintain a social distance of one meter (three feet) in lines — something that the length of the skis will help guarantee.

But it is masks off for the descent.

While Italy remained closed all last season to recreational skiers along with neighboring France, lifts in Austria were open to residents, and Switzerland welcomed skiers from anywhere. This year, France and Switzerland are enforcing mask mandates and social distancing, while Austria is limiting skiing to those who are vaccinated or recovered and Germany's Bavaria region is requiring that even vaccinated skiers show a negative test.

Italy's South Tyrol, bordering Austria, has the lowest rate of vaccinations in the country, and the government of the German-speaking autonomous province has imposed fresh restrictions in 20 towns in a bid to allow skiing and other holiday activities to resume normally.

They include the world-class Gardena Valley ski towns of Santa Caterina and Ortisei. Both are set to open Dec. 4, but it is not clear if that date can be kept.

“They need to absolutely get out of the red zone,’’ said Valeria Ghezzi, president of the ANEF ski lift association.

Operators said they are also waiting for word of how Italy’s new super Green Pass will be applied.

Over the holiday season, the government is restricting access to most indoor leisure activities — from museums to dining, theaters to cinemas — to those who are vaccinated or who have recovered from the virus in the past six months. While skiing has yet to be specifically addressed, Ghezzi said she believes the same restrictions will apply to mountains with closed lifts, which account for the vast majority of Italy’s ski resorts. Only a handful of ski areas in the Alpine foothills operate with only open lifts.

Ghezzi said it is important for everyone to follow the rules to ensure that the season can continue without bumps.

“The mood is very positive,’’ Ghezzi said. “There is still a little worry. It would be superficial not to be worried,” she said, citing soaring rates of contagion in neighboring Austria and nearby Germany, as well as Slovakia and Slovenia.

29,"Welcome to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s inspired by the daily TechCrunch+ column where it gets its name. Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up here.

Hello from the blisteringly cold East Coast of the United States, where I am eating doughnuts to ward off the effects of my COVID-19 vaccine booster shot. Thus far the third dose of Moderna is not as bad as the second, but who knows what is coming. So we’ll stay brief today in case I fall out of my desk chair and straight into a nap midkeystroke.

To start, thank you. This little weekend newsletter now has comfortably over 30,000 subscribers, and an open rate that sits in the mid- to high-40s each week. It’s part of a larger project I kicked off at TechCrunch when I came back but was far from a settled question when we added the newsletter to the regular Exchange columns.

Frankly, I figured it was a coin flip if it would get an audience. The bet wound up paying out, and because of you, The Exchange now publishes six times weekly. That’s just good fun. Thank you.

Now, risk!

A little while back we chatted through the point that risks from the startup market are slipping more frequently into the public markets. This meant that the regular investor can now get their hands on more nascent, higher-priced startup equity than before thanks to SPACs and some, well, interesting public offerings.

But inside that point was the implicit argument that startup risk is also rising for its private market backers. Let’s talk about what is going on:

Startup valuations are rising thanks to ample capital availability, limited investments with strong yield and related issues. You’ve heard this bit before.

Startup valuations are also rising thanks to more investors going earlier in the investing process. Again, you’ve heard this before. But you may not be aware of how it’s a self-reinforcing issue. Large funds can invest a stage “earlier” than they might given the size of their funds, essentially taking out an option contract on a larger purchase of shares in the startup in question without risking their overall returns profile. This pushes later-stage money, generally, earlier. And valuations rise as later-stage investors are less price-sensitive to early-stage valuations thanks to a dollar differential. More simply, if you have $1 billion to invest and you put $5 million into a Series A, you don’t care that much if it’s at a $65 million pre-money valuation or a $75 million pre-money valuation. What you do care about is putting $50 million more into winners when they raise their next round.

But there’s more: Venture investors report to The Exchange that startup valuations are rising in part thanks to growth rates not only proving stronger than anticipated at tech companies, but also that growth rates are proving to be more durable than expected. That’s to say that former startups are going public with faster growth than many expected, and they are holding onto that pace of expansion longer. The impact of that is that tech companies may be worth more in the future than anticipated, so investors can pay more now and not worry as much incrementally as you’d expect.

Another factor to consider regarding rising prices that Menlo investor Matt Murphy explained to me recently is that the old venture expectations of startup failure rates are now incorrect. The failure rate is lower than it was, and the all-important hit rate is higher, he said.

You might look at the above as a whole, and think well, maybe all those insta-unicorns and six-figure rounds make sense? It’s a somewhat comforting perspective to take. After all, the putatively smart money is taking the wager that faster, more durable growth and fewer failures — essentially that SaaS is hard to kill — will balance out higher costs to generate the sort of returns required to make venture math square up.

But, butttttttttt, there’s more and more risk being taken on because the fundamentals of the startup market have not improved much since the COVID-induced boom in software buying took off after the initial shocks of the pandemic wore off. That’s to say: The startups that venture investors are backing this year haven’t really seen their macro fortunes improve since mid-2020, but they are busy raising lots more money, lots faster. That generates increased investment risk.

There are more than 900 unicorns in the market today, all of which will need IPOs to generate the sort of return that their backers expect. If the market does finally correct a bit, just to get a little more historically aligned, quite a number of high-priced private companies could find themselves stuck in limbo between their private-market valuation and what the public markets might pay. It could get sticky. People are just betting that it doesn’t.

All this is to say that despite there being some reasonable reasons for why startup prices are going up as they also raise more capital, earlier and faster, it is hardly a zero-marginal-risk wager.

Now, go eat some leftovers and get the fuck offline.

30,"A former nurse will face trial for organizing three anti-lockdown protests in the UK, the Daily Mail reported.

Kay Shemirani lost her nursing license earlier this year after a medical panel found she fell ""seriously short of the standards expected of a registered nurse.""

Shemirani said the COVID-19 pandemic didn't exist and spread misinformation about the vaccines, the panel found.

A former nurse from the United Kingdom is expected to face trial next month for organizing three anti-lockdown rallies, the Daily Mail reported.

Kay Shemirani, also known as Kate Shemirani, is a vocal anti-vaxxer who lost her license to practice nursing in the United Kingdom earlier this year. A panel of nurses and midwives determined that she had fallen ""seriously short of the standards expected of a registered nurse and amounted to misconduct,"" according to a document outlining several charges against the case for her to retain her nursing license.

Shemirani had ""actively discouraged people from wearing masks, adhering to social distancing, and taking vaccinations,"" the panel said.

She has also ""been a leading speaker and/or lead organiser at a number of public events, including at an anti-Covid protest in London's Trafalgar Square,"" the panel said, and has had her account blocked by Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram for spreading misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic.

The panel, in its investigation, found that Shemirani had denied the existence of the COVID-19 pandemic. She also told national and local news outlets that vaccines are ineffective and have been ""rushed through"" because ""they want to kill you,"" the document says.

Shemirani has placed members of the public ""at serious risk of harm that could prove fatal,"" the panel found.

Health officials have been recommended that people get vaccinated against the coronavirus for months. Officials at both the local and national level have said that all three COVID-19 vaccines in the US are safe and effective.

Shemirani's lawyer plans to argue that the charges are ""unconstitutional,"" according to the Daily Mail.

""We are facing three charges of holding an event, which could be equated to organising the event, and very simply we submit we are not actually organisers,"" Robert Bullock said. ""There are other factors legally, on the basis of human rights. Of course, we are referring to the simple right of assembly. That is longstanding and that would simply have to be abolished."""
31,"PORTLAND, Maine — The last holiday season was far from the most wonderful time of the year for the U.S. Postal Service: Sick and quarantined workers, a flood of packages from shoppers loath to set foot in stores and a last-minute dump of packages from overwhelmed private shippers.

Postal workers who recall packages and letters piled up in distribution hubs are better prepared this time as they gear up for another pandemic crunch. But low product inventories, and port and supply chain disruptions are creating new uncertainty about getting gifts delivered.

Already, workers are seeing a surge in holiday packages that began several weeks ago.

“A lot of the workers are saying, ‘Oh no. Here we go again,’” said Scott Adams, local president of the American Postal Workers Union in Portland, Maine.

The U.S. Postal Service and private shippers UPS and FedEx are bolstering their hiring — bringing in about 230,000 temporary workers — and taking other steps to ensure they don’t become overwhelmed by packages.

Nearly 3.4 billion parcels are expected to crisscross the country this holiday season, representing an estimated increase of about 400 million compared to last year, said Satish Jindel, from Pennsylvania-based ShipMatrix, which analyzes shipping package data.

When cards and letters are included, the U.S. Postal Service said it’ll be delivering more than 12 billion items.

“The pandemic is still here. The supply chain is a challenge that’s going to impact how people shop and how products move,” said Mark Dimondstein, president of the American Postal Workers Union, which represents more than 200,000 postal workers.

Despite the precarious situation, the Postal Service, UPS and FedEx are in better shape to handle the peak volume, and several trends could work in their favor, Jindel said.

More people are shopping in stores compared to last year, and people have been placing online orders earlier because they’re keenly aware of supply chain problems, Jindel said. Also, with workers returning to offices, there are fewer office supply shipments being made to homes, he said.

Most importantly, the shippers are adapting after their rough-and-tumble experience last year, he said.

U.S. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, who faced withering criticism last year but reported on-time improvements and reduced operating losses this month, says the service is ready for the crunch.

“We are ready, so send us your packages and your mail,” he said.

A year ago, more than a third of Postal Service first-class mail was late by the time Christmas arrived.

Tractor-trailers stuffed with mail were left idling outside some postal-sorting facilities. Packages and letters piled up in distribution hubs. Delays grew by days, and then weeks, in many instances.

Two things were painfully obvious. More workers and more space were needed — and both are being addressed.

To get a handle of the volume, the Postal Service is transitioning more than 30,000 non-career employees to the ranks of career employees by peak season, hiring 40,000 seasonal employees, and leasing extra space at more than 100 locations to ensure there’s room for parcels.

The Postal Service installed more than 100 new package sorting machines as of early November, part of $40 billion of planned investment over 10 years. Also, more than 50 package systems capable of sorting large packages are expected to be deployed before December. Combined, these expand capacity by an additional 4.5 million packages per day, officials said.

UPS, for its part, is hiring more than 100,000 seasonal employees across the country and continues to add aircraft and automation. It expects nearly 90% of its packages to flow through automated facilities by year’s end.

FedEx, meanwhile, is in the process of boosting its nationwide workforce by 90,000 across its operating companies. Most of those new workers are expected to remain after the holidays, the company said.

Despite all those extra workers, the shippers agree that this is not the year for shoppers to procrastinate.

“Complete your holiday shopping as soon as possible,” said Jim Mayer, spokesperson for UPS.

32,"A group of up to 30 people robbed a Best Buy store in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul area on Black Friday, according to authorities.

The theft resembles other mass robberies recently seen across the country. In such cases, several robbers swarm a store, ransack the shelves and run away, sometimes assaulting shoppers and store employees in the process.

Police in Burnsville, a city south of downtown Minneapolis, said the group entered a Best Buy location near Burnsville Center after 8 p.m. and stole electronics. They fled before police arrived, CBS Minnesota reports.

No one in the group displayed a weapon and no injuries were reported.

No arrests were immediately made, and it's unclear how much merchandise was stolen.

In another incident, police in Maplewood, near downtown Saint Paul, said six people robbed a Best Buy before fleeing the scene in several vehicles.

Similar thefts have been continuing in California, where the LAPD issued a city-wide tactical alert on Friday after a large group rushed into a high-end clothing store and stole several items, CBS Los Angeles reports. A tactical alert means all available officers can be used to respond to incidents if necessary.

The station also reports that up to 20 men and boys stole sledgehammers and crowbars from a Home Depot in Lakewood, California on Friday evening, prompting fears they will be used in smash-and-grab robberies."
33,"“Before we had a chance to move, suddenly our tents were set on fire and they started throwing tear gas at us and shooting in the air,” Mr. Tavakoli said. He said the crowd included several families with young children and two babies.

“I never expected them to do this to us, to beat us, fire at us and injure farmers,” he added.

For more than two weeks, Mr. Tavakoli and hundreds of other farmers had been protesting on the dry bed of the city’s storied Zayanderoud River. Tens of thousands of people had joined them in a show of solidarity.

Their demand: Restore water flows to the river to help irrigate farmlands laid to waste from years of mismanaging water resources.

“We have nothing left of our lands and livelihoods, we are just asking for our water rights,” said Mr. Tavakoli. He owns three hectares of farmland that was once lush with crops of wheat, barley, and vegetables. The land has been dry and barren for 15 months, forcing Mr. Tavakoli to sell his livestock to survive.

Iran has been facing increasing water scarcity issues because of years of mismanagement. In the case of Isfahan, water has been diverted through underground pipes away from farmlands and toward industrial complexes in the desert province of Yazd and for drinking water to the religious city of Qom."
34,"TACOMA, Wash. — Gunshots rang out at a Washington mall packed with Black Friday shoppers, seriously wounding one person and panicking hundreds of others who hid inside stores as the mall went into lockdown.

Authorities said the shooting in Tacoma, south of Seattle, was reported just after 7 p.m. at an area near the mall’s food court. The person shot was taken to hospital with serious injuries, Tacoma Police said.

No suspects have been arrested, police said.

After the shots rang out at Tacoma Mall, shoppers sheltered in place or hid inside stores, which immediately went into lockdown.

More than 60 law enforcement officers from Tacoma, Pierce County, Lakewood, Puyallup and the Washington State Patrol responded.

Pierce County Sheriff’s Sgt. Darren Moss said police went in to conduct a “coordinated search” of the mall.

Fredrick Hoskins was shopping with his daughter inside the mall when he heard gunfire.

“There was a boom, boom, boom … boom, boom, boom. Maybe like six shots,” Hoskins, who previously served in the military, told The News Tribune. “It sounded like a revolver, and it sounded like one shooter.”

The Tacoma Mall is the city’s largest shopping mall, with more than 100 stores.

35,"On Friday, the World Health Organization officially named a new version of the SARS-CoV-2 virus a variant of concern, and attached the Greek letter omicron to the designation. The Omicron variant is notable for the sheer number of mutations in the spike protein of the virus. While Omicron appears to have started spreading in Africa, it has already appeared in European countries like Belgium and the UK, which are working to limit its spread through surveillance and contact tracing.

As of now, the data on the variant is very limited; we don't currently know how readily it spreads compared to other variants, nor do we understand the degree of protection against Omicron offered by vaccines or past infections. The new designation, however, will likely help focus resources on studying Omicron's behavior and tracing its spread.

Many changes

While the Delta variant's version of spike has nine changes compared to the virus that started the pandemic, Omicron has 30 differences. While many of these haven't been identified previously, a number of these have been seen in other strains, where they have a variety of effects. These include increasing infectiveness of the virus, as a number of the changes increase the affinity between the spike protein and the protein on human cells that it targets when starting a new infection.

Others changes in the spike occur in areas of the protein that are frequently targeted by antibodies that neutralize the virus. Changes here can mean that an immune response generated to vaccines or earlier versions of the virus are less able to target Omicron.

While these mutations are suggestive, understanding how they and the previously undescribed mutations in Omicron alter its behavior will depend on getting real-world data on its spread. Right now, however, we just don't have much of that.

We are lucky in the sense that it's relatively easy to detect Omicron. According to the WHO, some of the large collection of mutations in the gene that encodes the spike protein interfere with the gene's recognition by common versions of PCR tests. Those tests continue to recognize the presence of the virus by also targeting other areas of the genome. So a PCR test that comes back spike-negative but virus-positive is suggestive of the presence of Omicron, which can then be confirmed by genome sequencing.

These tests have shown Omicron is spreading rapidly within a number of countries in southern Africa, although the total cases in Botswana and South Africa remain relatively low at the moment, so the significance of this spread is unclear. Vaccination rates in these countries also remain low, making it difficult to determine how much of a risk Omicron poses to those who have been immunized.

Some constants

The cases identified outside of southern Africa so far have all been in travelers who spent time in this region. Public health authorities in those countries are currently engaged in contact tracing to try to limit the variant's spread outside of those already infected. and a number of countries (including the US) have already limited travel from countries in the region.

Testing and contact tracing are part of the now-familiar suite of public health measures that can limit the impact of Omicron while we're learning more about it. A statement from the CDC provides a reminder of the rest: social distance, mask when indoors, and get a vaccine if you are eligible. While we remain uncertain how much protection vaccines provide against Omicron, it's quite certain that their effectiveness against it is considerably greater than zero.

The new omincron coronavirus variant is raising alarm bells around the world with fears about a new surge of COVID infections. In response, Moderna said it is taking a three-prong approach to ensure its COVID vaccine can guard against the new mutation.

If you're 18 years of age and older, you now qualify for a Moderna booster shot. That goes for those fully vaccinated with the Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines, too, because you can now mix and match vaccines from approved drug-makers.

Authorization for the Moderna booster -- along with Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson booster shots and Pfizer vaccines for kids -- comes at a time when the deadly and contagious delta variant has a lock on the US and as the new omincron mutation emerges in South Africa.

Epidemiologists worry about another wave of COVID-19 infections as cold weather drives people indoors and as the annual flu season kicks in, socking immune systems. It also comes as a new COVID variant emerges in South Africa.

The COVID-19 vaccines have proved to be highly effective in preventing hospitalization, and those who are unvaccinated are 10 times more likely to be hospitalized if infected. With the federal vaccine mandates, the Biden administration aims to counter the surge and put pressure on anyone who hasn't been vaccinated. Antiviral drugs could also help.

Here's what you need to know about the Moderna booster, including its side effects. For more on COVID-19, here's the latest on COVID-19 vaccines for kids, what to do if you lost your vaccination card, the difference between a booster and a third dose, and what to know about breakthrough infections.

Now playing: Watch this: COVID-19 boosters and the delta variant: What you need...

What is Moderna's plan for its COVID vaccine and the new omincron variant?



In the US, the delta variant of COVID-19 -- which is nearly twice as contagious as earlier variants -- accounts for more than 99% of current infections. All three vaccines authorized for use in the US -- Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson -- are effective in guarding against infection from the delta variant, especially against severe disease.

A new COVID variant named omicron just found in South Africa is raising concerns among scientists. ""It is something to watch,"" said Maria Van Kerkhove, an infectious disease epidemiologist with the World Health Organization. ""What we know is that this variant has a large number of mutations. And the concern is that when you have so many mutations, it can have an impact on how the virus behaves,"" and that includes vaccines, Van Kerkhove said. With researchers just now examining the variant, it's not known how effective vaccines will be in guarding against infection.

To be ready for the new mutated virus, Moderna said it is taking a three-part strategy to be ready for the mutated virus:

1. Moderna said it's testing a 100 microgram dose of its booster to see if it provides better protection against the omincrom. The Moderna booster authorized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is a 50 microgram dose, half of what the CDC authorized for the first two shots of the Moderna vaccine.

2. The drug-maker is testing a COVID vaccine that could protect against several mutated strains of the COVID virus.

3. The company is working on an omicron-specific booster vaccine. Moderna said it could have a candidate of its micron-specific boosterin clinical testing in 60 to 90 days.

All adults are now eligible for the Moderna booster dose

As of Nov. 19, all adults -- those age 18 and older -- are eligible to get a booster shot of the COVID-19 vaccine. They qualify if it's been at least six months since they've received their second dose of either the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine. Those who received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine are eligible for a booster dose after two months. Adults are encouraged to get whatever booster dose is available to them, even if that means mixing and matching vaccine boosters (more below).

What about side effects with the Moderna COVID booster shot?



According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, those who got the Moderna booster dose reported fewer reactions than they did after the second dose of the vaccine. In its study, the CDC found 95% of those who got Moderna for the first round of vaccine shots chose Moderna for the booster dose.

Yes, it's safe to mix and match vaccine boosters

The US Food and Drug Administration has authorized mixing COVID-19 boosters, which in the US means Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson. Anyone eligible for a booster can get any of the available brands of coronavirus vaccines. If you initially received Johnson & Johnson and it's been two months or longer since you received the initial dose, you'll be able to get the Moderna or Pfizer booster. If you received Moderna or Pfizer for your first two shots, you could pick any authorized vaccine -- including J&J -- if you qualify and it's been six months or longer since your second shot.

What does the Moderna booster shot do?

A COVID-19 booster shot -- whether from Moderna, Pfizer or Johnson & Johnson -- tops off your immune response and guards against a breakthrough COVID-19 infection as the vaccine's effectiveness decreases over time.

Recent studies of the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines show that their effectiveness can begin to wane after six months. Moderna said early data suggests that those who received the Moderna vaccine in 2020 are showing a higher rate of breakthrough COVID infections than those vaccinated this year, suggesting the need for a booster to maintain high levels of protection.

Is the Moderna vaccine booster the same as the original two COVID-19 doses?

Yes, almost. As with Pfizer's booster, the third Moderna shot will be the same vaccine as the first two doses, except it'll be a half dose. To make your life simpler, Moderna is also working on a combination shot that includes this year's flu vaccine and its COVID-19 booster vaccine, but that is not available right now.

Where can I get the Moderna booster shot?

According to the White House, boosters will be available at roughly 80,000 places across the country, including over 40,000 local pharmacies. Some 90% of Americans have a vaccine site within 5 miles of where they live. You can check Vaccines.gov to see which vaccines are available where, or call 800-232-0233 for vaccine information.

Is the Moderna COVID-19 booster shot free, or do I have to pay?

All booster shots will be free, regardless of immigration or health insurance status. However, depending on where you get your booster shot -- for example, at a local pharmacy -- you may be asked to log your insurance status. You may be asked to provide your insurance card information, including your name, date of birth and membership number. You will not be charged for your COVID-19 vaccine or booster shot.

Will I need a fourth COVID booster shot?

The CDC updated its guidance to say that next year, some immunocompromised people will be able to get a fourth COVID-19 booster shot. It's unclear if other groups will need to get a fourth dose at this time.

For more on coronavirus treatments and vaccines, here's what we know about monoclonal antibody treatments, the new federal vaccine mandates and why some people may not want the shot.

37,"New York Gov. Kathy Hochul will halt non-urgent, elective surgeries in the state amid a spike in the new Omicron COVID-19 variant.

Mrs. Hochul signed an executive order on Friday, in hopes of preventing hospital staff shortages over an anticipated rise in cases.

“We’ve taken extraordinary action to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and combat this pandemic. However, we continue to see warning signs of spikes this upcoming winter, and while the new Omicron variant has yet to be detected in New York State, it’s coming,” Mrs. Hochul said.

The governor added that she will announce protocols to expand hospital capacity, and encouraged unvaccinated New Yorkers to get the shot and those already fully vaccinated to get their booster.

Mrs. Hochul’s order is a move that has not been done since the height of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, when hospitals across the country were over capacity.

The new variant was designated by the World Health Organization this week as omicron, named after a letter of the Greek alphabet.

The virus, supposedly expected to be more transmissible than other coronavirus strains, was first identified in South Africa.

No cases of omicron have yet to be identified in the United States, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, though the agency is monitoring potential breakthroughs.

The variant has been detected in travelers going into Belgium, Hong Kong, and Israel.

Two cases of omicron were also detected in the United Kingdom on Saturday.

The United States will restrict travel from non-U.S. citizens from South Africa starting Monday to prevent possible spread of the virus.

Seven other countries, including Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique, and Malawi, will also be included as part of the new restrictions.

39,"A Tennessee judge has vacated an inmate's death sentences after serving more than 30 years on death row.

The judge vacated the execution of inmate Pervis Payne after he was convicted in the 1987 killings of two people due to his intellectual disability, according to a report from CNN.

Shelby County Judge Paula Skahan wrote in an order that Payne's petition to remove the death sentences, ""is supported by two expert opinions concluding that Petitioner is intellectually disabled pursuant to Tennessee law as well as the decisions of the United States Supreme Court,"" according to the outlet.

Skahan vacated the sentence on Nov. 23, less than a month before Payne was scheduled for execution on Dec. 3.

Under 2002 Supreme Court ruling, it is unconstitutional to execute an inmate who is mentally disabled, but it was only after Gov. Bill Lee (R) signed a bill into law this year that changed Tennessee's definition of intellectual disability that Payne was able to make his case.

After the judge's decision, Payne could be seen hugging his attorney during an emotional moment with his lawyer.

Payne was found guilty of murder in connection with the deaths of a 28-year-old mother and her two-year-old daughter in a Memphis suburb. Payne has maintained he is innocent in their deaths.

A petition on change.org, pushing to free him, has garnered nearly 500,000 signatures as of Saturday.

Following the judge's decision this month, Payne's sentences have been downgraded to two life sentences, according to CNN.

Payne's family told the Innocence Project, an organization working to free those who are wrongfully convicted, they were delighted with the news he would not be executed, just two days before Thanksgiving.

“Thanksgiving for me will never be the same and I am sure I am speaking for my father as well,” said his sister Rolanda Holman.

“This will always be a monumental week from now on because that’s how I feel today. Although he is not able to come to the table and have Thanksgiving with us, it gives me such a drive and reignites my fire even more to work toward that day when he will be able to sit at the table with our family and have a good slice of turkey.”"
40,"The owners of a French bulldog that police said was stolen from a Huntington house in a Thanksgiving Day burglary are offering a $5,000 reward for the purebred's return.

Sometime between 4 p.m. and 11 p.m. on Thursday, one or more burglars entered the home, on Robin Lane, and took the dog and a Sony PlayStation 5 video game console, the department wrote in a news release.

""The French bulldog, Stella, is four years old and approximately 20 pounds,"" the release said.

The residents weren't home at the time, and whoever committed the theft may have entered through an unlocked rear door, according to an email from the police press office.

""Me and my wife have been married nine years. We have no kids. This is our kid. So someone came in our house and stole, like, in our opinion, our most valuable possession,"" owner Matthew Hauck, 34, a contractor, said Friday afternoon in a phone interview, as he wept. ""It’s just devastating.""

Hauck said the intruder probably entered through a balcony’s sliding door, while he and his wife were out at his brother house’s in West Hempstead for Thanksgiving.

""I think my dog would likely have approached them...cause she’s a very friendly dog, and I think they just grabbed her as part of the smash and grab,"" he said.

Upon returning home, the couple thought that perhaps the dog slipped out or couldn’t be found in the house.

""We start tearing the house apart, maybe she got into another room. She got past her — we have a little baby gate that keeps her in her space — and ultimately we thought she slipped past that … then we started searching the streets and the woods and everything, and then I came home in a panic after, like, 45 minutes of search.""

Then he saw the missing PlayStation 5, and then realized, ""the dog’s not missing; someone stole our dog.""

He said he got Stella from San Diego and picked her up there. She was named by Hauck’s wife, Jennifer, 35, a nurse.

Stella is microchipped — a ""radio-frequency identification transponder that carries a unique identification number, and is roughly the size of a grain of rice,"" as defined by the American Kennel Club — according to a poster distributed by the couple.

About 2 million dogs are stolen every year, according to the American Kennel Club, which calls the theft ""dognapping.""

The kennel club website says ""thefts often involve high-value dogs, for example Bulldogs and French Bulldogs, and smaller breeds such as Chihuahuas and Yorkshire Terriers,"" the website says.

""The one-of-a-kind French bulldog, with his large bat ears and even disposition, is one of the world's most popular small-dog breeds, especially among city dwellers... The bright, affectionate Frenchie is a charmer."""
41,"Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser, said Covid-19’s omicron variant may well already have arrived in the U.S.

“I would not be surprised if it is,” Fauci said on NBC’s “Weekend Today” on Saturday. “We have not detected yet,” but when a virus shows “this degree of transmissibility” it “almost invariably ultimately is going to go essentially all over,” he said.

Travel restrictions imposed by Biden on South Africa and seven other countries in the region are a way to buy time for the U.S. to prepare defenses against the variant and shouldn’t lead to panic, Fauci said."
42,"Riot police were deployed in force Saturday in the Iranian city of Isfahan, a day after dozens were arrested in violent protests over the drying up of a lifeblood river.

Security forces fired tear gas during the clashes with stone-throwers in the protest in the dry bed of the Zayadneh Rood river that crosses the city, Fars and ISNA news agencies said.

""We have arrested 67 of the main actors and agitators behind the troubles,"" police General Hassan Karami told on Saturday. He said between 2,000 and 3,000 ""rioters"" took part in the protest.

On Saturday, the situation was ""calm"" and streets empty, with riot police deployed on the city's Khadjou bridge, a Isfahan city resident said.

The demonstration was the latest since protests kicked off on November 9 in Isfahan, some 340 kilometres (210 miles) south of Tehran, a tourist magnet due to its majestic mosques and heritage sites, including a historic bridge across the river.

But it was the first to turn violent.

Between 30,000 and 40,000 farmers and city residents turned up for the gatherings last week, estimated Karami.

The riverbed has been the rallying spot for farmers and other people from across Isfahan province protesting the lack of water since November 9.

Drought is a cause, but they also accuse the authorities of diverting water from the city to supply the neighbouring province of Yazd, which is also desperately short on supplies.

""I used to walk along the riverbed with friends, but today the riot police are deployed in large numbers near the Khajou bridge and they are asking people to avoid the area,"" said a woman in her 50s.

During the clashes on Friday, some people set fire to objects in the city, Fars and ISNA reported.

""After the farmers left, the opportunists and counter-revolutionaries were left behind, which made it easy for the security apparatus, especially the police, to identify and arrest those who destroyed public and state property,"" Isfahan police chief Mohammad-Reza Mirheidari said on television.

But members of the security forces were hit by fire from hunting rifles, he said, without specifying how many.

One of them was stabbed, although his condition was not believed to be critical.

A Fars journalist said two bulldozers were used to destroy a pipe taking water from Isfahan province to Yazd.

""Among the injured demonstrators, two are in a serious condition,"" Nourodin Soltanian, spokesman for Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, told the Mehr news agency on Saturday.

Recently, there have been almost daily protests in the region of Isfahan, which has been particularly hard-hit by drought.

On Saturday, the ultra-conservative daily Kayhan pointed the finger of blame for the violence at ""mercenary thugs"", whereas the pro-reform Etemad said the protests in Isfahan showed a ""lack of trust in the government"".

Last Sunday, more than 1,000 people marched towards the governor's office in the western province of Chahar-Mahal Bakhtiari to demand a solution to water shortages, state media reported.

According to Fars, farmers and local authorities struck a deal on Thursday about water distribution.

President Ebrahim Raisi met with representatives from the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd and Semnan earlier this month and vowed to resolve water issues.

Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said the topic is the country's top problem, without making reference to the protests."
43,"The price to cross the English Channel varies according to the network of smugglers, between 3,000 and 7,000 euros ($3,380 and $8,000) though there are rumors of discounts.

Often, the fee also includes a very short-term tent rental in the windy dunes of northern France and food cooked over fires that sputter in the rain that falls for more than half the month of November in the Calais region. Sometimes, but not always, it includes a life vest and fuel for the outboard motor.

And the people who collect the money — up to 300,000 euros ($432,000) per boat that makes it across the narrows of the Channel — are not the ones arrested in the periodic raids along the coastline. They are just what French police call “the little hands.”

Now, French authorities are hoping to move up the chain of command. The French judicial investigation into Wednesday’s sinking that killed 27 people has been turned over to Paris-based prosecutors who specialize in organized crime.

To cross the 33-kilometer (20-mile) narrow point of the Channel, the rubber dinghies must navigate frigid waters and passing cargo ships. As of Nov. 17, 23,000 people had crossed successfully, according to Britain’s Home Office. France intercepted about 19,000 people.

At a minimum, then, smuggling organizations this year have netted 69 million euros ($77.7 million) for the crossing — that’s 2 million euros per kilometer.

“This has become so profitable for criminals that it’s going to take a phenomenal amount of effort to shift it,” the U.K. Home Office’s Dan O’Mahoney told Parliament on Nov. 17.

Between coronavirus and Brexit, “this is a golden age for the smugglers and organized crime because the countries are in disarray,” said Mimi Vu, an expert on Vietnamese migration who regularly spends time in the camps of northern France.

“Think of it like a shipping and logistics company,” Vu said.

The leg through central Europe can cost around 4,000 euros ($4,500), according to Austrian authorities who on Saturday announced the arrest of 15 people suspected of smuggling Syrian, Lebanese and Egyptian migrants into the country in van loads of 12 to 15 people. The suspects transported more than 700 people at a total cost of more than 2.5 million euros ($2.8 million), police said. In this network, the migrants were bound for Germany.

The alleged smugglers — from Moldova, Ukraine and Uzbekistan — were recruited in their home countries via ads on social media offering work as drivers for 2,000-3,000 euros ($2,250-3,380) a month.

The men handling the last leg are essentially just making the final delivery. If arrested, they are replaceable, Vu said.

Frontex, the European border agency, echoed that in a 2021 risk report that describes the operational leaders as managers who “are able to orchestrate the criminal business from a distance, while mostly exposing low-level criminals involved in transport and logistics to law enforcement detection.”

The chain starts in the home country, usually with an agreed-upon price, arranged over social media. That fee tends to shift over the journey, but most willingly pay extra as their destination grows closer, she said. That’s precisely when the logistics grow more complicated.

Channel crossings by sea were relatively rare until a few years ago, when French and British authorities locked down the area around the Eurotunnel entrance. The deaths of 39 Vietnamese migrants in the back of a container truck may also have contributed to a new reluctance to use that route.

But the first attempts were disorganized, using small inflatables and even kayaks bought at the local Decathlon sports store.

“At the beginning, it’s always the pioneers,” said Nando Sigona, professor of international migration and forced displacement at the University of Birmingham. “But once it started to seem that it was working for a number of people, you could see the bigger players came to be involved.”

One migrant from Sudan, who would only give his name as Yasir, had been trying for three years to get to the U.K.

While shaking his head about the tragedy, he pointed out that other methods of smuggling, such as hiding on a truck, were also dangerous. “You could break a leg,” he said. “You can die.”

And as dangerous as the sea voyage might prove, it seemed to many migrants to be safer than other options. The only thing preventing it is the cost, which he had heard was 1,200 euros ($1,350).

“We don’t have any money,” Yasir said. “If I had money, I’d go to the boat.”

Police cracked down on local boat purchases, and the larger inflatables started to show up, hauled by the dozens inside cars and vans with German and Belgian tags, police said. France’s interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, said a car with German tags was seized in connection with the investigation.

Police raids on the camps to pull down tents and disrupt operations have given smugglers yet another chance to make money, said Nikolai Posner, of the aid group Utopia 56. Now, the fee includes a short-term tent rental and access to basic food, usually cooked over an open fire.

“There is one solution to stop all this, the deaths, the smugglers, the camps. Make a humanitarian corridor,” said Posner. He said asylum requests should be easier on both sides of the Channel.

In part because of Brexit and coronavirus, expulsions from the U.K. this year dropped to just five people, according to the Home Office. Vu said people who are intercepted at sea or land by British border forces end up in migrant centers, but usually just get back in touch with the smuggling networks and end up working black market jobs.

That’s the complaint in France, where the interior minister said British employers appear more than happy to hire under the table, providing yet another financial incentive.

“If they’re in Calais, it’s to get to Britain, and the only people who can guarantee them passage are these networks of smugglers,” said Ludovic Hochart, a Calais-based police officer with the Alliance union. “The motivation to get to England is stronger than the dangers that await.”

On Sunday ministers from France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and EU officials will meet to search for solutions. But, with France and Britain at sharp odds over migration, fishing and how to rebuild a working relationship after Brexit, there is one notable absence: a British delegation.

For Vu, that’s a missed opportunity: “This is transnational crime. It spans many borders and it’s not up to only one country to solve it.”"
44,"The U.K. tightened up rules Saturday on mask-wearing and on testing of international arrivals after finding two cases of the new potentially more contagious omicron variant of the coronavirus.

Amid fears that the recently identified new variant has the potential to be more resistant to the protection offered by vaccines, there are growing concerns around the world that the pandemic and associated lockdown restrictions will persist for far longer than hoped.

Many countries have already imposed travel restrictions on flights from southern Africa in the four days since the omicron variant was first identified in South Africa.

In an attempt to slow the spread, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was necessary to take “targeted and precautionary measures” after two people tested positive for the new variant in England.

“Right now this is the responsible course of action to slow down the seeding and the spread of this new variant and to maximize our defenses,” he told a news conference.

Among the measures announced, Johnson said anyone arriving in England will be asked to take a mandatory PCR test for COVID-19 on the second day after their arrival and must self isolate until they provide a negative test.

And if someone tests positive for the omicron variant, then he said their close contacts will have to self-isolate for 10 days regardless of their vaccination status — currently close contacts are exempt from quarantine rules if they are fully-vaccinated.

He also said mask-wearing in shops and on public transport will be required and said the independent group of scientists that advises the British government on the rollout of coronavirus vaccines has been asked to accelerate the vaccination program, potentially by expanding the numbers eligible for a booster jab or allowing older children to get a second dose of vaccine.

“From today we’re going to boost the booster campaign,” he said.

One of the two new cases was found in the southeastern English town of Brentwood, while the other is in the central city of Nottingham. The two cases are linked and involve travel from southern Africa. The two confirmed cases are self-isolating alongside their households while contact tracing and targeted testing takes place.

The British government also added four more countries — Angola, Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia — onto the country’s travel red list from Sunday. Six others — Botswana, Eswatini (formerly known as Swaziland), Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe — were added Friday. That means anyone permitted to arrive from those destinations will have to quarantine.

Many countries have slapped restrictions on various southern African countries over the past couple of days including Australia, Brazil, Canada, the European Union, Iran, Japan, Thailand and the United States, in response to warnings over the transmissibility of the new variant — against the advice of the World Health Organization.

Despite the banning of flights, there are mounting concerns that the variant has already been widely seeded around the world. In addition to the U.K, cases have been reported in travelers in Belgium, Israel and Hong Kong. Germany also said it suspected a positive case and Dutch authorities were testing whether 61 people who arrived on two flights from South Africa with COVID-19 have the omicron variant.

Italian authorities in the southern region of Campania were also investigating whether a person who recently returned home from southern Africa and who has tested positive for the virus was infected with the omicron variant.

The World Health Organization has named the new variant omicron, labeling it a variant of concern because of its high number of mutations and some early evidence that it carries a higher degree of infection than other variants.

That means people who contracted COVID-19 and recovered could be subject to catching it again. It could take weeks to know if current vaccines are less effective against it.

With so much uncertainty about the omicron variant and scientists unlikely to flesh out their findings for a few weeks, countries around the world have been taking a safety-first approach, in the knowledge that previous outbreaks of the pandemic have been partly fueled by lax border policies.

Nearly two years on since the start of the pandemic that has claimed more than 5 million lives around the world, countries are on high alert.

The variant’s swift spread among young people in South Africa has alarmed health professionals even though there was no immediate indication whether the variant causes more severe disease.

A number of pharmaceutical firms, including AstraZeneca, Moderna, Novavax and Pfizer, said they have plans in place to adapt their vaccines in light of the emergence of omicron. Pfizer and its partner BioNTech said they expect to be able to tweak their vaccine in around 100 days.

Professor Andrew Pollard, the director of the Oxford Vaccine Group which developed the AstraZeneca vaccine, expressed cautious optimism that existing vaccines could be effective at preventing serious disease from the omicron variant.

He said most of the mutations appear to be in similar regions as those in other variants.

“At least from a speculative point of view we have some optimism that the vaccine should still work against a new variant for serious disease but really we need to wait several weeks to have that confirmed,” he told BBC radio.

He added that it is “extremely unlikely that a reboot of a pandemic in a vaccinated population like we saw last year is going to happen.”

Some experts said the variant’s emergence illustrated how rich countries’ hoarding of vaccines threatens to prolong the pandemic.

Fewer than 6% of people in Africa have been fully immunized against COVID-19, and millions of health workers and vulnerable populations have yet to receive a single dose. Those conditions can speed up spread of the virus, offering more opportunities for it to evolve into a dangerous variant.

“One of the key factors to emergence of variants may well be low vaccination rates in parts of the world, and the WHO warning that none of us is safe until all of us are safe and should be heeded,” said Peter Openshaw, a professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London."

BELGRADE, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Hundreds of environmental protesters blocked several major roads in Serbia on Saturday to protest against two new laws that they say will give free rein to foreign mining companies in the country.

Serbia's government has offered mineral resources to companies including China's Zijin copper miner (601899.SS) and Rio Tinto (RIO.L), but green activists say the projects would pollute land and water in the Balkan nation.

Chanting slogans against the government and conservative President Aleksandar Vucic, demonstrators brought traffic to a standstill in the centre of Belgrade and blocked a stretch of a main highway through the Serbian capital.

In the northern city of Novi Sad, dozens of protesters briefly scuffled with police and protest organisers said several activists had been detained.

""I'm angered because we're an occupied country ... I don't know why (other) people are silent,"" said Marija Popovic, 35, a protester in Belgrade.

The protesters are angry over a recent referendum reform, which they say will effectively stop popular initiatives against polluting projects by establishing hefty administrative fees.

They are also opposed to a new expropriation law, which allows the mandatory acquisition of private land by the state within eight days.

Serbia is one of Europe's most polluted countries and will need billions of euros to meet the European Union's environmental standards if it wants to join the bloc.

Rio Tinto has said it would adhere to all domestic and EU environmental standards at its lithium mine in Serbia. The government said it would organise a referendum to test popular support to Rio's project. read more

46,"Social media is ablaze after video emerged on Friday, Nov. 19, of police pepper-spraying and tasing a Black teenage student during a wide-scale disruption at a high school in suburban Dallas-Fort Worth.

The boy, who has not been identified, was part of a demonstration at the school in support of a female schoolmate who has alleged she was groped and harassed on a school bus in October.

Chaos ensues after Texas police tase and pepper spray a teen during a school protest. (Screenshot from cellphone footage)

Hundreds gathered in the hallways of the school in Little Elm, Texas on the last Friday before Thanksgiving after information spread on social media that a sophomore named Jaelyn was placed on in-school suspension after she was found talking to the person she accused of sexual misconduct.

The students walked out of their classes around 10:20 a.m. that day. One student witness said officers attempted to gather the students by linking their arms together and pushing the students back. Still, the students broke through their human chain. Swiftly, chaos ensued.

Students filmed the law enforcement officers as they shot pepper spray at a group of students and tased another as he came toward the officers. Videos were uploaded, and within minutes parents wanted to know what was going on.

Multiple videos show the police and students confronting each other. In one video, a Black boy is seen being pepper-sprayed and tasered to the ground. Afterward, the officer can be seen grabbing and dragging him by his shirt.

Civil rights attorney Ben Crump tweeted about the incident. “Texas Police pepper-sprayed and TASED Little Elm high school students who were protesting their school’s handling of sexual assault! This is ridiculous! These students were standing up for what is RIGHT. This excessive police response is disgusting.”

One white student tried to step in to protect another student and says he was tased also.

The junior, Kaden Throckmorton, told the local NBC affiliate, “He pushes me away, he pulls out his Taser and pushes me with the Taser and he’s like, ‘Hey, you need to back off.’ I’m like, ‘He’s not breathing, we need to do something about this.’ And he ends up putting the Taser to my stomach, he Tases me, one of the other officers pushes me on the shoulder, he actually rips my shirt.”

Story continues

He continued his account, saying, “I was just running off all of the adrenaline in my body. I knew that when he tased me my stomach tensed up.”

“I knew that what I was doing was for the better good,” he concluded. “I was just scared. I was scared.”

Chaplain Crystal Bates from the DFW Metro chapter of the NAACP commented on the videos she saw and called them “very disturbing.” She also said, “I’m concerned to know what are the policies for this district.”

Officials report four students were arrested that day. Superintendent Daniel Gallagher would later say that a large group of students in pursuit of others tried to break into an office during the protest.

The town of Little Elm has launched a website, LittleElmFacts, to give their side of what happened on Friday.

The city’s explanation about the Black teen who was tased and stretched out on the floor in the viral videos appears under a section titled “What happened on the first floor?” It reads as follows:

“This is the scene captured on the videos currently circulating on social media and in the news. Officers were transporting the people arrested through the building. That’s when a third person – a male student wearing a light-colored warm-up jacket and pants — attempted to interfere with the arrest. This crime is a Class A Misdemeanor. Video shows that student aggressively advancing on the officers escorting one of the students from the second-floor incident. Based on this aggressive action, another officer used pepper spray to deter the assault. When the student continued to charge at the officer, the officer was forced to deploy a Taser device to stop further advances.”

On the site, Little Elm Police Chief Rodney Harrison shares with the public that an outside “use of force expert” will be brought in to help the department decide if “the actions of these officers” were excessive.

47,"It is possible that omicron, a new Covid-19 variant first detected in South Africa, could already be in the United States, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

While there are no confirmed cases of the new variant in the states, Fauci said he ""would not be surprised"" if omicron already made its way to the U.S.

""We have not detected it yet, but when you have a virus that is showing this degree of transmissibility and you're already having travel-related cases that they've been noted in Israel and Belgium and in other places, when you have a virus like this, it almost invariably, is ultimately going to go essentially all over,” Fauci told Weekend TODAY Saturday.

The new variant is concerning because it ""has a large number of mutations"" that potentially makes this virus more contagious than other variants and more transmissible, according to Fauci.

""We don't know that yet but we're going to assume that's the case"" he said, adding that the large number of mutations also suggest that the new variant ""could evade the protection"" of coronavirus treatments such as monoclonal antibodies and convalescent plasma as well as the Covid-19 vaccines.

""These are all maybes but the suggestion is enough,"" Fauci said. ""This is something we got to pay really close attention to and be prepared for something that's serious. It may not turn out that way, but you really want to be ahead of it.

Two cases of the variant have been identified in the U.K., Health Minister Sajid Javid said Saturday. He added that the people involved were linked to each other and to travel to southern Africa, where omicron was first detected earlier this week.

As public health experts try to find concrete answers to questions around whether the omicron variant causes more severe illness and if it can evade protection from vaccines and treatments, President Joe Biden announced new travel restrictions on Friday.

Restrictions for travelers from South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique, and Malawi are set to begin Monday.

Travel restrictions are only helpful to gives the U.S. more time to better assess the situation and respond accordingly, it won't stop the spread of the new variant, Fauci said.

Fauci, who also serves as Biden's chief medical advisor, doubled down on how it is ""absolutely essential that unvaccinated people get vaccinated and that vaccinated people get boosters"" and wear masks during indoor congregations."

Nord Stream 2 is an important part of Putin’s effort to exert economic and military pressure on Ukraine because it would allow Russia to send gas to Europe without going through the country.

It’s a tough spot for Biden because while the president wants to be careful of German economic interests, he’s also under pressure to respond to Moscow's increasingly bellicose posture toward Ukraine.

U.S. intelligence has detected a buildup of Russian troops along the Ukrainian border in preparation for a possible military invasion, according to a report from Bloomberg.

Risch and Cruz will continue to press for a vote when the Senate resumes debate on the legislation after Thanksgiving. Risch last week objected to moving the Defense bill without the amendment.

It would be a tough vote for Senate Democrats who have supported using sanctions to stop the construction of Nord Stream 2.

They called the pipeline “a clear tool of Russian malign influence in Europe” and part of “a clear geopolitical goal for Russia to exert long term influence over Europe’s energy fortunes.”

“The Trump Administration failed to permanently stop this pipeline, and for almost four years never used the sanctions tools available to do so, so we appreciate your leadership during this critical period as the pipeline is close to completion,” Menendez and Shaheen wrote in a March 23 letter to Blinken.

The administration tried to give some ground to their allies this week by announcing limited sanctions on the pipeline project.

Blinken informed Congress on Monday that the U.S. had imposed sanctions on a ship owned by Transadria Ltd., which is owned by a Russian shell company and helped construct the pipeline.

But the administration didn’t take any action against another ship that worked on the pipeline, Blue Ship, because it has German-affiliated ownership.

Critics say the sanctions announced this week will do nothing to stop the completion of Nord Stream 2, which would then give Putin the ability to shut off or curtail gas flows to Ukraine to achieve its foreign policy objectives.

Steven Pifer, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who specializes in U.S. relations with the former Soviet Union and Europe, also said the sanctions announced by Blinken on Monday will have little effect.

“I don’t think they’re going to have any impact,” he said. “The bigger issue would be whether there would be sanctions on other European or German companies. That seems to be a line that the Biden administration at this point is not prepared to cross.”

He said Germans who favor the pipeline argue that U.S. officials didn’t begin expressing serious opposition to it until late 2019, at point which the project was almost complete, and point out that billions of euros have already been invested in the project.

49,"Democratic leadership condemned Islamophobic remarks made by Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) about Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) where she suggested Omar was a terrorist and called her a member of the “jihad squad.”

“Racism and bigotry of any form, including Islamophobia, must always be called out, confronted and condemned … We call on the Republican Leadership to address this priority with the congresswoman and to finally take real action to confront racism,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democratic House leadership wrote in a statement late Friday.

Boebert was filmed over Thanksgiving break telling a story about an encounter with Omar in the Capitol — a story that Omar has since said is entirely untrue. But far be it from Boebert to let the truth get in her way.

“Actually I have an Ilhan story for you,” Boebert told a crowd at an event in her home district. “So the other night on the House floor was not my first jihad squad moment.”

“I was getting into an elevator with one of my staffers, and he and I were leaving the Capitol. We’re going back to my office, and we get in the elevator, and I see a Capitol Police officer running hurriedly to the elevator. I see fret all over his face, and he’s reaching. The door is shutting. I can’t open it. What’s happening?” Boebert said. “I look to my left and there she is, Ilhan Omar, and I said, ‘Well she doesn’t have a backpack, we should be fine.’ So we only had one floor to go and I say, do I say it or do I not? Looked over and I said, ‘Oh look, the jihad squad decided to show up for work today.’ “

As the audience laughed and cheered, Bobert added, “Don’t worry, it’s just her staffers on Twitter that talk for her. She’s not tough in person.”

Responding to Boebert’s comments, Omar tweeted on Thursday, saying, “Fact, this buffoon looks down when she sees me at the Capitol, this whole story is made up. Sad she thinks bigotry gets her clout. Anti-Muslim bigotry isn’t funny & shouldn’t be normalized. Congress can’t be a place where hateful and dangerous Muslims tropes get no condemnation.”

On Friday, Omar House leadership to address the congresswoman’s bigotry: “Saying I am a suicide bomber is no laughing matter. [House Republican Leader] Kevin McCarthy and [Speaker] Nancy Pelosi need to take appropriate action, normalizing this bigotry not only endangers my life but the lives of all Muslims. Anti-Muslim bigotry has no place in Congress.”

Representatives for Leader McCarthy did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Rolling Stone.

Boebert finally released an apology Friday afternoon on Twitter to the Muslim community. “I apologize to anyone in the Muslim community I offended with my comment about Rep. Omar. I have reached out to her office to speak with her directly,” the congresswoman wrote. “There are plenty of policy differences to focus on without this unnecessary distraction.”

It’s particularly rich that Boebert claims Omar is a danger to Congress when Boebert is the one who has promised to carry her Glock with her in the Capitol and was caught trying to bring a gun onto the House floor. Members of Boebert’s staff also coordinated with organizers of the Jan. 6 Stop the Steal rally that turned into a violent assault on the Capitol, according to reporting by Rolling Stone."

A 25-year-old man in Pennsylvania was shot during a Thanksgiving meal with his family.

Edilberto Miguel Palaez Moctezuma was shot in the chest by a stray bullet that entered through the window.

Local police told 6abc Action News that Moctezuma was not the intended target.

A 25-year-old man in Pennsylvania was fatally shot in the chest on Thursday while having a Thanksgiving meal, 6abc Action News reported.

The man, Edilberto Miguel Palaez Moctezuma, had been eating his dinner with his family members in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, when a stray bullet entered through the window and struck him.

District Attorney Kevin Steele told 6abc Action News that Moctezuma was not the intended target. Kevin Clarke, 19, has been charged in connection with Moctezuma's death, 6abc Action News reported.

Police believe the shooting was connected to an incident at another house that happened earlier in the day. Clarke and his girlfriend had been asked to leave a family party after her cousin accused them of stealing alcohol.

Clarke's girlfriend, Jacqueline Brown, returned the alcohol later that evening, 6abc Action News said. Her cousin allegedly pulled out a gun when she pulled up to his home in her car, and a shootout between her cousin and Clarke began.

""Mr. Palaez Moctezuma was murdered while eating Thanksgiving dinner inside his home, and to be clear, he and his family were not involved in the dispute between Clarke and others,"" Steele said.

Neighbors described hearing multiple shots.

""I was sitting in my home enjoying my TV and Thanksgiving night and I heard what I thought at first was fireworks, and lo and behold it was five shots. After that I heard another eight shots,"" one neighbor told 6abc Action News. Moctezuma's house is located less than a block away from the site of the shootout.

Police said a bullet fired from Clarke's gun had resulted in Moctezuma's death.

When pictures started circulating in early November of QAnon supporters crowding Dallas’s Dealy Plaza, where John F. Kennedy was assassinated, in anticipation of the second coming of the slain president and the arrival of John F. Kennedy Jr., his dead son, it became a political Twitter joke.

Now, some three weeks later, some middle-aged and boomer QAnon followers are still there, and the incident has more clearly shifted from a laugh to something enduring and darker. While the event’s organizer, Michael Brian Protzman, and his followers have so far only been disruptive, Mother Jones has learned that he has previously faced formal allegations of violence, as documented in a 2019 arrest on an “unlawful imprisonment – domestic violence” charge.

Protzman’s wife told a cop he was “acting differently, not showering…and believing in government conspiracies.”

According to court records from Washington state’s King County obtained and provided to Mother Jones by Amanda Moore, an independent researcher focused on the right, in July 2019, Protzman allegedly “held [his wife] down on the bed, using both of his hands to physically restrain her, using one of his legs to brace hers,” and “held her in this position for approximately two to three minutes until she told him that she would agree to marriage counseling so he would let her up.” When she then tried to leave the house, the documents say, Protzman grabbed her and prevented her from departing. She ultimately made it to a neighbor’s home, barefoot, where she called 911 and said that “she is scared of Michael because he has ‘blind rage’ and she believes he may hit her.” According to a police report, she complained that Protzman had recently “been acting differently, not showering or working and believing in government conspiracies.” She also claimed Protzman had assaulted her before, strangling her roughly six years earlier.

The case was ultimately dismissed without prejudice this past June, meaning that it was closed with the potential to be reopened. Neither Protzman or his wife responded to requests for comment.

Details coming out of Dallas event make the Protzman-led gathering look increasingly concerning. Vice News detailed how the event is tearing some families apart. Participants went three weeks ago, abandoning spouses and children; many haven’t come back and won’t say when they will. People have reported that relatives have given $200,000 to Protzman and the group he helped assemble.” Known by his followers as Negative48, Protzman recently took part in a livestream where he endorsed another participant’s fatalistic language about experiencing “physical death” to “let go of our ego” and find truth.

What in the fresh hell is he saying… They all have to go through physical death to let go of the ego to witness the truth? WHAT?! How?! pic.twitter.com/hsNvyv2JGT — Hot Tub Twin (@hottub_twin) November 21, 2021

One relative of someone taking part in the Dallas convening told Vice News that her sister there “is being forced to drink a hydrogen peroxide solution and take ‘bio pellets’ to ward off COVID-19” and complained that calls and messages were being monitored.

Vice has also detailed Protzman’s history of antisemitism. In the past he has denied the holocaust and boosted an obscure conspiratorial film that posits that Jewish people engineered the twentieth century’s world wars.

Protzman’s sect of QAnon is fringe, even by the standards of an already absurd conspiracy theory. The notion that JFK Jr. is alive and has some role to play in the conspiracy was never broadly considered QAnon cannon. The account posing as Q never posted about it on 8chan in its infamous “QDrops,” the messages that purportedly contained hints gleaned from a career in government intelligence.

Yes, a new variant has emerged. On Friday, the WHO designated a fourth, possibly more transmissible “variant of concern”—B.1.1.529 or Omicron—after a steep increase in COVID-19 infections in South Africa.

Health officials have detected the variant in Belgium, Britain Botswana, Hong Kong, Israel, and the United Kingdom. As of Friday, there have been no cases of Omicron detected in the United States, according to the CDC. But as a “precautionary measure” the Biden administration joined several other nations in issuing new travel restrictions from South Africa and seven other countries. On Saturday, New York declared a state of emergency over the variant. Since the news of Omicron broke, the stock market has taken a notable hit.

The news is worrisome, but as top infectious disease official Dr. Anthony Fauci and other scientists have cautioned, there’s plenty we don’t know about Omicron—including if it spreads more readily, if it causes a more severe COVID infection, or if our vaccines will continue to be effective against it.

In the meantime, here are a few things we do know about it:

Omicron has a large number of mutations. And it’s spreading rapidly in South Africa.

As SARS-CoV-2 replicates, it makes mistakes. As I wrote earlier this year, these mistakes are called mutations. Most of the time, mutations don’t help the virus. But over many (many!) replications in millions of hosts, some mutations may give the virus a competitive edge over its predecessors. “It starts to compete with the standard strain,” John Swartzberg, a clinical professor emeritus specializing in infectious diseases and vaccinology at UC Berkeley’s School of Public Health told me, “and that’s the one that would be of concern.” Over many failures, the virus can evolve into a more “fit” version of itself.

That may be what’s happened with Omicron. It has a lot of mutations—more than 30 in the spike protein, the Washington Post reports. That is bad news because it could mean the virus is better at getting around our body’s defenses. “This is the most concerning variant we’ve seen since Delta,” Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, told the Washington Post on Friday.

It’s unclear how exactly the mutations affect the virus, but their existence and the rise in cases in South Africa—where about 35 percent of people are fully vaccinated—have worried scientists. “We have seen a lot of variants pop up over the last five, six months, and most of them have not amounted to much. This looks different,” Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, told CNN. “It’s acting differently, it looks like it’s much more contagious than even the Delta variant.” He added, “This one has become dominant very quickly in South Africa in the regions where it’s been found. Within a matter of days to weeks as opposed to months. Now, the number of cases in South Africa is quite low, so it can be for other reasons as well, not just because it’s more transmissible. But the speed with which it has taken off is really unlike anything we’ve seen before.”

You can expect to see data on Omicron and the vaccines soon.

According to Jha, the possibility that our vaccines will be “rendered useless” by Omicron is low: “I think that’s exceedingly unlikely,” he told CNN. “The question is, is there a tiny hit to vaccine efficacy, or is there a large hit? I think we’ll get some preliminary data probably in the next few days.”

Fauci said it is unknown if people immunized against COVID-19 will be protected against Omicron. “Right now, you’re talking about sort of like a red flag that this might be an issue, but we don’t know,” Fauci said in an interview with CNN. “Once you test it, you’ll know for sure whether or not it does or does not evade the antibodies that we make.”

Vaccine makers are working to test and develop vaccines against variants, including Omicron.

Vaccine makers are on the Omicron case. The Wall Street Journal reports, “Germany’s BioNTech SE, which developed one of the most commonly used Covid-19 vaccines with Pfizer Inc., said it would take about two weeks to establish whether the new variant renders its shot less effective.”

“In the event that vaccine-escape variant emerges, Pfizer and BioNTech expect to be able to develop and produce a tailor-made vaccine against that variant in approximately 100 days, subject to regulatory approval,” a Pfizer spokesperson added in a statement.

Moderna announced on Friday that it plans to “rapidly advance” an Omicron-specific booster, in addition to boosters for other variants of concern. In the past, the company said, it’s taken 60 to 90 days to advance a vaccine candidate to clinical testing."
56,"NEW CASTLE, Ind. — Two New Castle men arrested as a result of the same investigation have each been charged with dealing in meth.

Tony E. Spradlin, 42, was taken into custody on Monday after members of the Henry County Area Drug Task Force saw him emerge from a house that was under surveillance due to reports of drug-related activity there.

Spradlin — who allegedly tried to flee from police — was found to be in possession of about 15 grams of meth, according to a news release.

The New Castle man is charged in Henry Circuit Court 1 with dealing in meth, a Level 2 felony carrying up to 30 years in prison, and resisting law enforcement, a misdemeanor.

Judge Bob Witham set Spradlin's trial for April 25. He continues to be held in the Henry County jail under a $34,000 surety bond and a $2,800 cash bond.

When they searched a garage at a family member's home where Spradlin had reportedly been staying, investigators said they found more than 22 grams of meth, more than 11 grams of synthetic marijuana and paraphernalia including ""a large amount of needles.""

Apprehended there was Branden Craig Shelton, 36, who was later charged in Circuit Court 1 with dealing in meth, dealing in a controlled substance, unlawful possession of a syringe and possession of paraphernalia.

He was being held without bond in the county jail.

At the time of his latest arrest, Shelton was awaiting trial on four charges filed in Circuit Court 1 in January — dealing in meth, possession of a narcotic drug, possession of a controlled substance and possession of paraphernalia.

His trial in that case is set for Feb. 14.

57,"Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU) is slated to report its results for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 (essentially the August-to-October period) after the market close on Thursday, Dec. 9.

Investors in the athletic apparel retailer are probably feeling optimistic about the report. Last quarter, revenue and earnings crushed Wall Street's consensus estimates, third-quarter guidance for both the top and bottom lines came in higher than analysts had been expecting, and management significantly hiked its full-year outlook for both revenue and earnings. Moreover, many investors are enthused about the company's potential to be a major player in the growing home connected-fitness market, thanks to its acquisition of Mirror last year.

In 2021, Lululemon stock is outrunning the market. Through Nov. 26, it's up 31.3% versus the S&P 500's 23.9% return.

Here's what to watch in Lululemon's upcoming report.

Lululemon's key numbers

Metric Fiscal Q3 2020 Result Lululemon's Fiscal Q3 2021 Guidance Wall Street's Fiscal Q3 2021 Consensus Estimate Wall Street's Projected Change Revenue $1.12 billion $1.40 billion to $1.43 billion $1.43 billion 28% Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) $1.16 $1.33 to $1.38 $1.41 22%

Investors can probably expect that the company's sales and earnings were hurt to some degree by the pandemic-driven global supply chain issues that are afflicting retailers and many other types of companies. That said, Lululemon's management has been doing a good job limiting the impact of this headwind.

For context, last quarter (essentially the May-to-July period), Lululemon's sales soared 61% year over year to $1.45 billion, sprinting by the 47% growth Wall Street had expected. Growth was driven by a 142% surge in company-operated stores' revenue to $695.1 million, as many consumers returned to shopping in brick-and-mortar stores. Direct-to-consumer sales rose 8% to $597.4 million. Adjusted EPS skyrocketed 123% to $1.65, leaving the analyst consensus estimate of $1.19 in the dust.

Last quarter's results were particularly strong because of the easy year-ago comparable. The year-ago period occurred early in the pandemic when consumers were cutting back their spending on non-essential products.

Mirror

Management hasn't been providing sales data for Mirror, ""a nearly invisible interactive home gym,"" to use Lululemon's words. But investors can expect an update on the earnings call about the company's relatively new home connected-fitness business.

On last quarter's earnings call in early September, CEO Calvin McDonald said the company had Mirror shop-in-shops in 150 Lululemon stores with plans to increase that number to 200 by the holiday season. He added that the company would soon introduce Mirror to the Canadian market. Indeed, in early October, Lululemon announced that Mirror would be available in 40 of its stores across Canada and available for online purchase in the country beginning on Nov. 22.

Guidance for the holiday quarter

As always, Lululemon's guidance, relative to Wall Street's expectations, should be a major factor in the market's reaction to its upcoming report. Investors will likely be putting significant weight on the quarterly outlook because the holiday period is particularly important to retailers. For fiscal Q4 (essentially the November-to-January period), Wall Street is modeling for revenue to jump 28% year over year to $2.21 billion and adjusted EPS to also increase 28%, to $3.30."
58,"Bad luck would be better than the luck the Tennessee Titans have had as far as injuries are concerned. The team placed Pro Bowl receiver A.J. Brown on injured reserve Saturday, one day ahead of the team's Week 12 matchup against the New England Patriots. Brown's injury is not considered season-ending, according to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport.

Brown did not practice this week after sustaining a chest injury during last week's loss to the Houston Texans. In 10 games this season, Brown has caught 46 of 78 targets for 615 yards and three touchdowns. The 51st overall pick in the 2019 draft, Brown broke the 1,000-yard receiving barrier during his first two seasons with the Titans. He was selected to his first Pro Bowl in 2020 after catching 70 passes for 1,075 yards and 11 touchdowns.

A.J. Brown TEN • WR • 11 TAR 78 REC 46 REC YDs 615 REC TD 3 FL 0 View Profile

Brown is the latest Titans starter to be placed on injured reserve. Fellow receiver Julio Jones was placed on injured reserve earlier this month as the former All-Pro continues to deal with a hamstring injury that has sidelined him for five games. November started with the Titans placing reigning two-time rushing champion Derrick Henry on injured reserve after Henry underwent foot surgery. Last Saturday, the Titans placed pass rusher Bud Dupree on injured reserve with an abdominal injury.

Despite the injures, the Titans are 8-3 and would be the AFC's top-seeded team if the playoffs started today. Tennessee, who will on its bye week following Sunday's game against the Patriots, have just two remaining games against teams with winning records."
59,"The Sixers are assigning Paul Reed to their NBA G League affiliate, the Delaware Blue Coats, this weekend. Reed, who starred in the developmental league last season as he won MVP and was named the Rookie of the Year, will make his first G League appearance since last year's championship in the Orlando bubble on Saturday.

As the Blue Coats are set to take on the Toronto Raptors affiliate, Raptors 905, on Saturday afternoon, Reed will be available for Delaware. While Reed will be a member of the Blue Coats this weekend, he isn't expected to stay with them for long.

According to a team official, the expectation is that the Sixers are going to recall Reed for their next game, which is set for Monday. However, when the Sixers take on the Minnesota Timberwolves on Saturday, Reed won't be around.

The decision by the Sixers to assign the second-year forward/center hybrid to the G League shouldn't come as much of a surprise. While Paul Reed has seen his playing time increase as the Sixers have missed key players such as Joel Embiid and Tobias Harris, there was a point during the Sixers' road stretch where Reed seemingly fell out of favor with Doc Rivers temporarily.

Over the last five games, Reed has averaged roughly eight minutes on the court. And lately, Sixers rookie Charles Bassey has been seeing his playing time increase as Embiid remained off the floor.

While Reed is expected only to play one game for the Blue Coats, the matchup should be an excellent confidence booster for the second-year veteran as he'll likely garner some considerable playing time in Delaware rather than battling for small shifts in Philly.

60,"ASHBURN, Va., -- The Washington Football Team, on a two-game winning streak, should have additional offensive help available Monday night vs. Seattle as tight end Logan Thomas and receiver Curtis Samuel are expected to play, barring a last minute-change in their health.

Samuel is listed as questionable; Thomas remains on injured reserve but the expectation is that he'll be activated in time to play Monday. Both would be limited to a snap count coach Ron Rivera said, though Thomas likely would play more than Samuel.

Thomas hasn't played since hurting his hamstring in the first quarter of an Oct. 3 win at Atlanta. He returned to practice Wednesday. Thomas has caught 12 passes for 117 yards and two touchdowns this season.

Samuel's likely return was aided by a steroid and anti-inflammatory injection he received last week, the final step in allowing him to recover from a groin injury suffered in late spring.

""He's been trending up,"" Rivera told reporters of Samuel. ""We feel very comfortable and confident with him.""

Samuel practiced all week and If he indeed plays, he'll be limited to a snap count - likely no more than 15. He last played on Oct. 10 vs. New Orleans, lasting only two snaps before his groin started to bother him again.

Samuel suffered the initial injury during OTAs and underwent surgery in early June. He's been slowed by missing two weeks of practice and rehabbing in August due to having Covid-19. When he did return, Washington played him more than desired vs. Atlanta on Oct. 3 due to losing other players during the game to injury.

Samuel spent the first three games on injured reserve because of the injury. But since re-injuring it, Washington did not want to put him on injured reserve because he'd then be done for the season.

Samuel visited noted core muscle surgeon Dr. William Meyers, who performed the initial core muscle surgery in June, several times. After recommending that Samuel rests to let the injury ""calm down"", Samuel returned to Philadelphia to visit Meyers last week. Following an MRI, he received the injection.

""He's done everything he's supposed to do,"" Rivera said of Samuel earlier this week. ""All I know is since he came back [from Philadelphia], he's been great.""

Samuel returned to practice the week of the season opener but tweaked his groin and was soon placed on injured reserve.

Samuel has played 27 snaps this season. He played 25 snaps vs. Atlanta - 10 to 15 more than the initial number they wanted him to play.

""That's our fault,"" Rivera said of Samuel tweaking his groin vs. Atlanta. ""No matter what we shouldn't have done it. We screwed it up and he had a setback. ... We were getting desperate.""

That's because Washington receivers Cam Sims (hamstring) and Dyami Brown (knee) left that game with injuries as did tight end Logan Thomas (hamstring). It left Washington thin at receiver, causing Samuel to play more.

Rivera said he's been patient with Samuel in part because of what he saw him do as a rookie. Samuel suffered ligament damage and broke his ankle during the season.

""He rehabbed his ass off,"" Rivera said. ""He also bought a Jugs machine to work on catching balls [while rehabbing]. I know this kid is dedicated. He wanted to play last week, but he wasn't ready.""

Thomas' return comes at a good time with his backup, Ricky Seals-Jones, out with a hip injury. Rookies John Bates was the primary tight end target in last week's win at Carolina. He's primarily a blocking tight end, but did finish with three catches for 23 yards.

Thomas will help in the red zone. In 19 full games with Washington, Thomas has caught 18 of 20 passes thrown to him in this area for 144 yards and eight touchdowns. Even though Thomas has missed six games this year, he still has the most yards of any tight end in the red zone over the past two years combined and he's tied for fifth in touchdowns."
61,"The Get Up crew share their picks for the AFC battle between the Titans and the Patriots. (1:40)

Will the Patriots keep their winning streak alive vs. the Titans? (1:40)

The Tennessee Titans have placed star receiver A.J. Brown on injured reserve, it was announced Saturday.

Brown had not practiced this week after suffering chest, rib and hand injuries during last week's 22-13 loss to the Houston Texans.

The Titans will likely turn to rookie Dez Fitzpatrick to start in place of Brown in Sunday's game against the New England Patriots. The Titans did not elevate veteran Golden Tate from the practice squad.

In 10 games, Brown has 46 receptions for 615 yards and three touchdowns. He also missed Tennessee's Week 4 loss to the New York Jets because of a knee injury. The Titans had already ruled Brown out for Sunday's game at the Patriots on Saturday.

In another moves, the Titans activated running back Khari Blasingame off injured reserve. He'll be eligible to play vs. New England.

Also, receiver Cody Hollister and defensive end Kevin Strong were elevated from the practice squad."
62,"Keep up with the many job openings in the FBS this fall at The Grove Report

The college football head coaching carousel is spinning earlier, and faster, than any other season as far as most can compare.

USC kicked most of the movement off in firing Clay Helton in September, while similar moves went down at LSU and TCU in the middle of the season.

As of the last week of November 27 Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) head coaching jobs have already come open and plenty more are on the way. Sports Illustrated is tracking the macro, so The Grove Report will go micro, considering the success of the Ole Miss program this year.

Lane Kiffin's name will always be a popular one to throw out when coaching decisions are to be made and now offensive coordinator Jeff Lebby is beginning to pick up momentum in the same light, especially with multiple jobs opening in his native state of Texas.

We will keep track of the carousel in one, easy-to-read place, as all the money is being put together by various departments.

LSU

Out: Ed Orgeron

In: TBD

The Latest: Kiffin, Baylor's Dave Aranda, Michigan State's Mel Tucker and even Texas A&M's Jimbo Fisher have been mentioned for the gig in Baton Rouge. Louisiana's Billy Napier is also worth keeping an eye on despite reports of LSU administration ready to spend a big check.

USC

Out: Clay Helton

In: TBD

The Latest: James Franklin has been the wire-to-wire name to know in the USC vacancy, despite several losses in 2021 and even mis-speaking leading up to the Ohio State game. Franklin even changed representation, hiring Jimmy Sexton at this awfully coincidental time.

Florida

Out: Dan Mullen

In: TBD

What was expected finally happened. Mullen was relieved of his duties following Florida's 24-23 loss to Missouri on Saturday. The Gators must win on Saturday to claim a bowl bid over Florida State. Mullen will finish his time at Florida with a 35-15 record. The Gators reached three New Year’s Six bowls in Mullen's first three seasons, winning a Peach Bowl and an Orange Bowl, and captured the SEC East title last season before losing in the Cotton Bowl. Early names to consider include Billy Napier, Luke Fickel and of course Kiffin.

Virginia Tech

Out: Justin Fuente

In: TBD

The Latest: Fuente and the Hokies mutually elected to part ways following a six-year run in Blacksburg. Hired away from Memphis in 2016, Fuente went 43-31 during his time with the program. Early names that are expected to be in the running for the Hokies including Louisiana's Billy Napier, Coastal Carolina's Jamey Chadwell, Liberty's Hugh Freeze, SMU's Sonny Dykes and others.

TCU

Out: Gary Patterson

In: Sonny Dykes

The Latest: The worst-kept secret in the coaching carousel was finally let out of the bag by various reports on Friday, and it appears Dykes will bring a host of SMU coaches over to TCU in the process.

Washington

Out: Jimmy Lake

In: TBD

The Latest: This job may be viewed as one of the more surprising openings to date in the 2021 cycle. The program announced the decision on Sunday, for reasons on and off the field.

Washington State

Out: Nick Rolovich

In: TBD

The Latest: One of the more unexpected job openings came via off-field reasoning, so Wazzu has its hands full in figuring out what's next. Oklahoma defensive coordinator Alex Grinch, former Washington coach Chris Peterson and even longtime coach Jim McElwain have been mentioned for this one.

Texas Tech

Out: Matt Wells

In: Joey McGuire

The Latest: Baylor associate head coach and former Texas high school coach Joey McGuire is the pick for Texas Tech, in a move that makes a lot of sense given how unique it is to recruit to Lubbock. He hit the ground running, too.

SMU

Out: Sonny Dykes

In: Rhett Lashlee

The latest: Pretty cut and dry as Dykes to TCU was as much a no-brainer as former OC Lashlee to leave his post as Miami's play-caller to lead the Mustang charge.

Troy

Out: Chip Lindsey

In: TBD

The Latest: Even the Group of Five programs are operating with a quick trigger these days. Lindsey got three years at Troy and wrapped up his tenure with a 15-19 record. On Saturday, the Trojans fell 45-7 to Appalachian State.

Akron

Out: Tom Arth

In: TBD

The Latest: Speculation is all over the place for the MAC job, from former Zip quarterback Charlie Frye to high school coaches in the state of Ohio.

Connecticut

Out: Randy Edsall

In: Jim Mora

The Latest: UConn somehow found a way to upgrade with the hire of the former NFL and UCLA head coach, who has ties to regions throughout the country. Some time off likely did him well, though eh stayed close to the game as an analyst for various media outlets.

Massachusetts

Out: Walt Bell

In: Don Brown

The Latest: Late over the weekend, reports surfaced of Arizona defensive coordinator Don Brown taking the UMass head coaching job, with an announcement Monday morning.

Florida International

Out: Butch Davis

In: TBD

The Latest: On Monday morning, somewhat expected, multiple reports came in suggesting the program would move on from Butch Davis following the conclusion of the 2021 season later this month. Football Scoop was on this in October, citing Davis' age and lack of success in Miami over recent seasons, including a winless 2020 in the abbreviated campaign. FIU lost to Middle Tennessee 50-10 on Saturday to fall to

Georgia Southern

Out: Chad Lunsford

In: Clay Helton

The Latest: The first coach to get canned was the first to officially be named to his new gig. GSU announced Helton as the next head coach on November 3, less than two months after that dreadful USC performance against Stanford that got him bounced. The fit in his native

The new COVID-19 omicron variant is posing new risks for the American people as President Biden and his administration attempt to control the spread of a virus he vowed to ""shut down"" during the 2020 campaign.

The omicron variant, according to World Health Organization (WHO) officials, has a large number of mutations, ""some of which are concerning.""

On Friday, Biden restricted travel from South Africa and seven other countries over concerns of the ""heavily mutated"" variant, which has been identified in Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique and Malawi.

OMICRON COVID-19 VARIANT CASES IDENTIFIED IN UK: LIVE UPDATES

Earlier this week, prior to the implementation of the travel ban, White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain boastfully touted Biden's handling of the pandemic, telling anyone who ""wants to have a debate about COVID"" to ""bring it on.""

""Let's be clear: the day we got here, 4000 people a day were dying and one percent of Americans were vaccinated. Today, deaths are down 75 percent, and almost 200 million Americans are fully vax'ed,"" he said in a tweet. ""We still have a LOT of work to do.""

""But if anyone wants to have a debate about COVID, bring it on,"" Klain added.

According to Biden, he is taking advice on how to deal with the omicron variant from Dr. Anthony Fauci and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which recommended the newly established travel restrictions.

Biden, who was extremely critical of Trump's travel restrictions into the United States due to fears over coronavirus, once claimed America ""should lead the way with science"" and insisted travel bans during a global pandemic are xenophobic.

""We are in the midst of a crisis with the coronavirus,"" Biden wrote in a tweet during his presidential campaign last year following Trump imposed travel restrictions from China into the United States in an effort to control the spread of COVID-19. ""We need to lead the way with science — not Donald Trump’s record of hysteria, xenophobia, and fear-mongering. He is the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health emergency.""

Biden's inability to ""shut down"" the virus has led to pandemic fatigue, which White House press secretary Jen Psaki attributed to Biden's low approval ratings. Psaki said Americans are ""tired of fighting"" back against the coronavirus and its ""impact on their lives.""

Fauci said Saturday morning that he would ""not be surprised"" if the omicron variant had already found its way into the U.S., adding that the strain has a large number of mutations that would suggest it could potentially evade immune protection and that scientists can predict it will be more transmissible.

A number of pharmaceutical firms, including AstraZeneca, Moderna, Novavax and Pfizer, said they have plans in place to adapt their vaccines in light of the emergence of omicron.

The White House is continuing to urge Americans to get COVID booster shots in order to help stem new variants.

David Robinson, 53, was awaiting arraignment after being arrested Friday on murder and manslaughter charges in the death of Htwe Than Than. It wasn't immediately clear whether Robinson had an attorney who could comment on the allegations, and no phone number for his home could immediately be found.

Police said the 58-year-oldl victim was walking up some steps in a station in Manhattan's Chinatown with her 22-year-old son on July 17 when Robinson grabbed the son's backpack, propelling both son and mother down the stairs. She was in a coma for several days before succumbing to her injuries.

A seamstress who made aprons, she came to the U.S. from Myanmar about three years ago, according to WABC-TV, which interviewed her family in July.

The New York Police Department publicly identified Robinson as a suspect later that month.

The assault happened amid a wave of concern about crime, particularly in subways, in the nation's most populous city. Crime spiked in the subway system as ridership plunged during the early part of the coronavirus pandemic.

He was exonerated without DNA evidence, which disqualified him from being compensated by the state, despite spending decades behind bars, his lawyers said. Mr. Strickland, 62, said on Friday that the community did not owe him anything for his wrongful imprisonment.

“The courts failed me and that’s who should be trying to make my life a little more comfortable,” he said. “I really do appreciate the donations and contributions they made to try to help me acclimate to society.”

Mr. Strickland said the four days back in Kansas City had been overwhelming.

UK PM Johnson announces new measures to try to stop spread

Many states announce travel curbs, bans on southern Africa

Dutch authorities test air passengers for Omicron variant

Czech Republic has suspected Omicron cases

LONDON/BERLIN, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Britain and Germany each detected two cases of the new Omicron coronavirus variant on Saturday and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced new steps to contain the virus, while more nations imposed restrictions on travel from southern Africa.

The discovery of the variant has sparked global concern, a wave of travel bans or curbs and a sell-off on financial markets on Friday as investors worried that Omicron could stall a global recovery from the nearly two-year pandemic.

The two linked cases of the new variant detected in Britain were connected to travel to southern Africa, British health minister Sajid Javid said.

Speaking later, Johnson laid out measures that included stricter testing rules for people arriving in the country but that stopped short of curbs on social activity other than mask wearing in some settings. read more

""We will require anyone who enters the UK to take a PCR test by the end of the second day after their arrival and to self-isolate until they have a negative result,"" Johnson told a news conference.

People who had come into contact with people testing positive for a suspected case of Omicron would have to self-isolate for 10 days and the government would tighten up the rules on wearing face coverings, Johnson said, adding the steps would be reviewed in three weeks.

The health ministry in the German state of Bavaria also announced two confirmed cases of the variant. The two people entered Germany at Munich airport on Nov. 24, before Germany designated South Africa as a virus-variant area, and were now isolating, said the ministry, indicating without stating explicitly that the people had travelled from South Africa.

Czech health authorities also said they were examining a suspected case of the variant in a person who spent time in Namibia.

England's Chief Medical Officer, Chris Witty, said at the same news conference as Johnson that there was still much uncertainty around Omicron, but ""there is a reasonable chance that at least there will be some degree of vaccine escape with this variant"".

Omicron, dubbed a ""variant of concern"" by the World Health Organization, is potentially more contagious than previous variants of the disease, although experts do not know yet if it will cause more or less severe COVID-19 compared to other strains.

The variant was first discovered in South Africa and had also since been detected in Belgium, Botswana, Israel and Hong Kong.

""I’ve been told that they expect that a lot more people will test positive after five days. It's a little scary the idea that you’ve been in a plane with a lot of people who tested positive,"" she said.

Financial markets plunged on Friday, especially stocks of airlines and others in the travel sector, as investors worried the variant could cause another surge in the pandemic. Oil prices tumbled by about $10 a barrel.

It could take weeks for scientists to fully understand the variant's mutations and whether existing vaccines and treatments are effective against it.

TRAVEL CURBS

Although epidemiologists say travel curbs may be too late to stop Omicron from circulating globally, many countries around the world - including the United States, Brazil, Canada and European Union nations - announced travel bans or restrictions on southern Africa on Friday.

On Saturday, Australia said it would ban non-citizens who have been in nine southern African countries from entering and will require supervised 14-day quarantines for Australian citizens returning from there. read more

Japan said it would extend its tightened border controls to three more African countries after imposing curbs on travel from South Africa, Botswana, Eswatini, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Lesotho on Friday.

Britain also said it was expanding its ""red list"" to put travel curbs on more southern Africa countries, while South Korea, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Oman and Hungary also announced travel restrictions on southern African nations.

South Africa is worried that the curbs will hurt tourism and other sectors of its economy, the foreign ministry said on Saturday, adding the government is engaging with countries that have imposed travel bans to persuade them to reconsider. read more

Omicron has emerged as many countries in Europe are already battling a surge in COVID-19 infections, and some have re-introduced restrictions on social activity to try to stop the spread. Austria and Slovakia have entered lockdowns.

VACCINATIONS

The new variant has also thrown a spotlight on disparities in how far the world's population is vaccinated. Even as many developed countries are giving third-dose boosters, less than 7% of people in low-income countries have received their first COVID-19 shot, according to medical and human rights groups.

Seth Berkley, CEO of the GAVI Vaccine Alliance that with the WHO co-leads the COVAX initiative to push for equitable distribution of vaccines, said this was essential to ward off the emergence of more coronavirus variants.

“While we still need to know more about Omicron, we do know that as long as large portions of the world’s population are unvaccinated, variants will continue to appear, and the pandemic will continue to be prolonged,"" he said in a statement to Reuters.

""We will only prevent variants from emerging if we are able to protect all of the world’s population, not just the wealthy parts.""

During last year's Cyber Monday sale, Target offered buyers an additional 15% off on select vacuums that were already on sale; 25% off on select heating pads and humidifiers; and up to 50% off on power tools.

69,"Two people in the United Kingdom have tested positive with the omicron variant of the coronavirus, a new contagious strain that has spurred governments to shut down travel from southern Africa.

U.K. Health Secretary Sajid Javid confirmed on Saturday that two people in the towns of Chelmsford and Nottingham have been infected with the variant. He said the two cases were linked and connected with travel to southern Africa.

“These individuals are self-isolating with their households while further testing and contact tracing is underway,” Mr. Javid tweeted. “As a precaution we are rolling out additional targeted testing in the affected areas — Nottingham and Chelmsford — and sequencing all positive cases.”

He added that Britain is also placing Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Angola to its travel “red list,” effective 4 a.m. Sunday. The U.K. on Friday named South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, Namibia and Zimbabwe to its red list.

Those who have returned from these countries in the last 10 days must isolate themselves and get PCR tests, according to the health secretary. He also urged those eligible for booster shots to go get the extra doses.

“This is a fast-moving situation and we are taking decisive steps to protect public health,” Mr. Javid said.

Many countries including Canada, Brazil, Australia, the European Union, Iran, Japan, Thailand and the U.S. have placed restrictions on various African countries over the past couple of days to try and contain the variant’s spread, the Associated Press reported.

The omicron variant also has been detected in Belgium, Hong Kong and Israel with a suspected positive case in Germany. Dutch health authorities said on Saturday they found 61 COVID-19 cases among people who flew from South Africa on Friday and will perform further tests to see if the travelers are infected with the omicron variant, Reuters reported.

The Biden administration announced on Friday that it is restricting travel from South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique and Malawi in response to concerns about the omicron strain. The travel ban will take effect Monday.

No cases of this variant have been identified in the U.S. so far, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday.

“CDC is continuously monitoring variants and the U.S. variant surveillance system has reliably detected new variants in this country. We expect Omicron to be identified quickly, if it emerges in the U.S.,” the federal health agency said in a statement.

The World Health Organization on Friday formally designated the omicron variant, first detected in South Africa, as one “of concern.” The strain, also known as the B.1.1.529 variant, was first discovered in a sample collected Nov. 9.

“This variant has a large number of mutations, some of which are concerning. Preliminary evidence suggests an increased risk of reinfection with this variant, as compared to other [variants of concern],” the WHO said Friday. “The number of cases of this variant appears to be increasing in almost all provinces in South Africa.”

Clarification: This has been updated from an earlier version to more accurately reflect the U.K.’s self-quarantine policy for those returning home from the affected countries.

70,"Nick Vojnovic grows chain restaurants. The former president of Beef ‘O’Brady’s is now president of Little Greek Fresh Grill and also Green Market Cafe. In 10 years, he expanded Little Greek from four restaurants in two states to 44 in six states. He received the 2021 Silver Plate award from the International Food Service Manufacturers Association for career achievement and community service in the category of fast-casual restaurants.

He is also the recipient of a bone marrow transplant for a deadly blood disease called myelofibrosis. One woman in 26 million people proved to be a genetic match — a then-22-year-old American University student named Caroline Gómez. Her donation gave him a 60 percent chance of surviving. It will be five years in January.

“I’m a lucky guy,’’ he says.

Vojnovic, 62, of Tarpon Springs, talked with the Tampa Bay Times about the chain restaurant business and the disease that would have killed him.

You graduated from Cornell University. What was your major?

My younger brother and I both (majored in), they called it hotel administration. At Cornell, we were considered the knuckleheads. We were the guys, “What is your test, how to set a table?” We literally would be walking up the hill with chef coats. We were not very well-respected at Cornell University.

What are the risks of expanding a chain restaurant? Can you do it too quickly?

That’s one of the mistakes we made, I think, at Beef ‘O’Brady’s. We grew too fast. We were doing 50 stores a year, and what happens is you start rushing the locations. You pick locations, “Well, it’s close enough.” The cost to build them got high. It was ‘07, ‘08, the economy was booming, and the construction costs jumped up. So we sold the company in ‘08 and when the economy turned, a lot of stores closed.

There’s two different kinds of restaurants. There’s companies like Outback that open all their own restaurants. They own them, they sign leases, they build them. And then most restaurant chains are franchises — Taco Bell and McDonald’s and all that. That’s kind of what I do now. We franchise. We sell a franchise model and they pay a fee — usually right now $30,000 — to kind of get the rights to open a store. We find the location, negotiate the lease. We help them design it; we help them build it. We train them, we provide an opening unit support team, and then we provide ongoing support.

What’s the key to making them a success?

The key for me is a good owner-operator. If you’re not a good owner-operator, I can’t guarantee that you’re going to make money. You have to be a good businessperson, take good care of your customers, run a clean restaurant, make sure the food’s good — high quality and clean and fresh. You’ve got to be on top of your game.

If a franchisee isn’t doing well, it tarnishes the image of the whole chain, doesn’t it?

Correct. In 10 years, we had one store close. … We’ve had several sell. But, generally, if you’re not good, we find someone to buy you out. Sometimes some people just aren’t cut out for the business.

How are you affected by the worker and supply shortage?

Right now, you can’t get employees, you can’t get food. I just got a phone call: Our stores in Dallas, they’re out of baklava. They have to wait two weeks for another order of baklava because it’s coming from Tarpon Springs from Hellas Bakery. That’s never happened. In 10 years we’ve never had a shortage like that. ... The guys who make our pita bread said, “Nick, we can make pita bread. We have the bag, but we don’t have the little clip that goes on the bag.” … Little things ruin the whole deal. If you don’t have the clip, you can’t do it.

Are restaurants going to have to raise salaries?

Yes. … We have to pass that on. Our profit margins are 15 percent on a good day. … Usually in the restaurant business your wages are 30 percent of your costs. So if both food and labor go up, we have to pass that on just to be able to keep them open. ... I think, just talking to my industry friends, you’re going to see restaurant (prices) go up 10 percent. That’s just to even try to keep up with what we were making before. You’re not making more money, you’re just trying to keep up.

You found out about your blood disease when you signed up to donate bone marrow for a child with leukemia, you say.

And I got picked, and all of a sudden they said, “We can’t use you.” I said, “What do you mean, I’m healthy as an ox. I’ve never been in a hospital a day in my life.” “Something’s wrong with your blood.’’ … Instead of being oval, like normal blood cells, mine were teardrop-shaped with a little point, so they wouldn’t last as long. But my bone marrow could keep up. Well, over the next 15 years the bone marrow started wearing down, and that’s (when) my red counts … they started going down. And so I went in there, and the gal says you’ve got one to three years to live.

Ah, terrible.

And (they) said, well, the only good thing is you’re a good candidate to get a stem cell transplant, but it’s a 60/40 percent survival rate.

And then Caroline Gómez came into the picture.

They said you have to wait a year to meet her, because if you die, we don’t want her to be disappointed. … Most people don’t make it through the first year. … Caroline Gómez saved my life.

Do you keep in touch?

Yeah. I’m hoping to get invited to her wedding. She lives up in D.C. My daughter got married last year and they came down for the wedding.

And you’re feeling good?

Aside from taking eight pills a day, I would not know I was sick. I’m in the top 10 percent of the patients. I’m a lucky guy.

So I go to the beach every night to catch the sunset, to be thankful for another day. … Sunset Beach, every night if the weather is good, and I do an hour walk and I sit down on the same bench and I watch the sun go down. As I always tell my friends … it’s a good day to be alive.

71,"Following back-to-back losses to ranked teams by the same exact score at the Hall of Fame Classic this week, a return home is in order for Kansas State, who will play host to North Dakota on Sunday.

Kansas State (2-2) lost by the identical 72-64 score to both No. 13 Arkansas and No. 14 Illinois in the event at Kansas City, Mo., at least showing they are within single digits of matching some of the top teams in the nation.

Perhaps the most positive sign for the Wildcats, coming off a 9-20 season a year ago, is the fact that they are not satisfied with being in near proximity on the scoreboard to a couple of quality squads.

""I'm not happy,"" Kansas State head coach Bruce Weber said. ""We lost. I think we showed that we can do it, but now can we shore up those little things to take a step? We're not that far off. It's just disappointing. I expected better and I still expect more. Hopefully, we can rise to my level of expectation. I hope they have that desire. Now they have to do that.""

The Wildats have been led by a variety of players. Four different players have led Kansas State, or shared the lead, in scoring in four games. Nijel Pack, who leads the team with 15.5 points per game, has tied for the scoring lead in two games while also leading by himself in the team's season opener. Transfers Markquis Nowell (11.5 points), Ismael Masoud (8.3) and Mark Smith (7.8) have helped to contribute to the bulk of the offense.

North Dakota (2-4) has lost three straight games entering Sunday's game. In the most recent loss, 65-56 at Florida International on Wednesday, the Fighting Hawks led the entire game until less than 6:41 minutes remained. A pair of scoring droughts allowed the game to get away.

Paul Bruns led the Fighting Hawks with 18 points, and he's third on the team with 9.7 points per game. Caleb Nero (13.3) and Mitchell Sueker (11.3) are the team's top scorers.

Kansas State is 2-0 all-time against North Dakota, with the most recent victory coming in 2015.

72,"KALAMAZOO, MI -- A Kalamazoo shooting that injured three people happened on a Metro bus, Kalamazoo Police Chief Vernon Coakley said.

Police then shot a suspect who had exited the bus, injuring him. The bus was at or near the Kalamazoo Transportation Center at Burdick Street and E. Kalamazoo Ave.

Coakley released more details about the 9:15 a.m. Saturday, Nov. 27 shooting in the early afternoon hours.

He said the three people injured on the bus were hit in extremities and the injuries were not believed to be life-threatening. All were taken to hospitals for treatment.

The shooter’s motive was not immediately clear, Coakley said.

“The suspect boarded a bus and began firing rounds,” he said.

At some point, the man exited the bus and was shot by police. Other details surrounding the encounter with officers was not clear.

Police earlier described the event as an “active shooter situation.”

Coakley said he was thankful the three people on the bus were not more seriously injured.

Metro bus service has been suspended for the remainder of Saturday as police continue to investigate the incident and speak with drivers.

Kalamazoo Department of Public Safety investigators remained at the scene early Saturday afternoon. Burdick Street was closed between Ransom Street and North Rose Street.

73,"By Blake Farmer, Nashville Public Radio

Jason and DeeAnn Dean recently relocated to her hometown of Dellrose, Tennessee, where she grew up on a farm. Both in their late 40s, they’re trying to start a green dream business that combines organic farming with a health and wellness consulting company. They want to inspire people to grow their own food in this fertile rolling farmland, just north of the border with Alabama.

Until the business fully launches, Jason is working construction. In May, he was injured on the job site when a piece of sheet metal slipped and caught him on the kneecap. He bled quite a bit. After closing the wound with a butterfly bandage, he thought that might be enough. But on his drive home, he figured it’d be best to have a professional stitch it up.

It was late in the day, and the emergency room seemed the best option since his doctor’s office was closed. He and DeeAnn had opted for a health plan with lower monthly payments and a high deductible. So, he knew the cost of care wouldn’t be cheap — and he was right. When the bills for thousands of dollars came, they were shocked. They were in the midst of fighting them in August when DeeAnn started feeling as bad as she’s ever felt.

“I haven’t eaten. I’m not drinking. I have a horrible fever. I can’t get out of bed. I’m shaking,” she said.

She was pretty sure she had contracted COVID-19 — the delta variant was surging across the South. The natural-health fanatic was kicking herself for putting off vaccination. She got tested and the result was negative. She visited a doctor the next day, who said her condition was bad enough to go to the ER — but she regarded that option as financially unacceptable.

“That is fear,” said DeeAnn. “If they charged Jason this much, what would they charge me?”

She was terrified of a potential bill from the same ER in Pulaski, Tennessee, that had treated her husband. So even though she was deliriously ill, she hit the road in search of cheaper treatment, asking her parents to drive her. They headed south first to an ER in Huntsville, Alabama, but it was so full of covid patients, she would have had to wait all day. Then, they drove north nearly an hour to Maury Regional Medical Center, a public hospital in Columbia, Tennessee, where she was diagnosed with Rocky Mountain spotted fever, a potentially deadly tick-borne infection. She got treatment with appropriate antibiotics and IV fluids.

“I would have had organ damage or possibly death in a few days,” she said.

And then the bills came.

The Patients: Jason and DeeAnn Dean, entrepreneurs and aspiring organic farmers who bought a BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee insurance plan with a deductible of $8,000.

Medical Services: Jason received six sutures for a laceration on his knee and a tetanus shot. DeeAnn received diagnosis and treatment for Rocky Mountain spotted fever.

Total Bills: Jason was charged $4,582.77 by the hospital for a Level 4 emergency visit, including $497.40 for a tetanus shot. The ER physicians who treated him sent a separate bill of $2,007, for a total of $6,589.77. The Deans’ share of these bills came to $4,278.05. At a different ER, DeeAnn was charged for a Level 4 emergency and lab tests. BCBST paid a negotiated rate of $1,990.63 and the Deans owed $566.33.

Service Providers: Jason received care at Southern Tennessee Regional Health System-Pulaski, part of the LifePoint Health hospital chain. DeeAnn received care at Maury Regional Medical Center, a county-owned hospital in Columbia, Tennessee, about twice as far from her home as the Pulaski hospital.

What Gives: The Deans were snagged by a host of major problems in American health care: very high billing, obscure pricing, high-deductible insurance plans and few options for care in rural areas. The net result could have cost DeeAnn her life.

When Jason went to the only local ER for stitches, the staff assured him his insurance would cover the treatment. “I’m not versed in medical billing or medical law,” he said. “So I said, ‘Let’s go ahead and stitch it up.’”

It took 30 minutes. Despite his questions about coverage, no one ever told him what he would be charged. He guessed no more than $1,000 for the 30-minute visit.

Then, a few weeks later, he began receiving bills. The hospital charged a total of $4,582.77, asking him to pay $3,391.25 for his six stitches.

LifePoint Health, the hospital’s owner, is a large hospital chain headquartered in Nashville that specializes in rural hospital operations. The ER physicians, who sent a separate bill for $2,007 (discounted to $886.80), are part of TeamHealth, based in Knoxville. His ER visit was coded as Level 4 on the five-level scale. A Level 4 is supposed to require a detailed examination and medical history, along with decision-making of moderate complexity.

Both the physicians and the hospital are part of companies recently taken over by private-equity investors. TeamHealth has been sued by the nation’s largest health insurer, UnitedHealthcare, for overusing Level 4 and Level 5 charges on bills. It’s a practice insurance companies refer to as “upcoding.” TeamHealth calls the accusation an attempt at “downcoding” a physician’s expertise.

Both companies, through spokespeople, essentially said Jason’s charges are what they are. LifePoint wouldn’t discuss specifics.

DeeAnn was still worried about her Maury Regional bill, especially after a battery of tests and being hooked to IV fluids. But, despite the high level of care she received and having the same high-deductible plan as her husband, she’s out only $600 — an amount she said she will gladly pay.

As is so often the case with Bill of the Month sagas, the question of responsibility has all sides blaming the others. TeamHealth, the ER staffing firm, which controls billing in an estimated 17% of all emergency rooms, blames insurers for selling high-deductible plans. And patients.

“Unfortunately, it is all too common that patients are not knowledgeable about their financial responsibilities under high-deductible plans,” TeamHealth spokesperson Greg Blair said in a written statement.

And the high prices do come at a cost for people’s health. For 1 in 10 Americans, according to the Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker, costs cause patients to put off necessary care.

Resolution: The Deans spent hours on the phone, asking the hospital and the physicians’ group to review the charges for Jason’s $1,000-per-stitch care. Both companies are sticking by the original bills. But the Deans are still fighting.

DeeAnn said they regret gambling on a high-deductible plan. But the difference in monthly premiums was substantial compared with low-deductible plans, especially when they’re launching a business, and the risk seemed minimal given their lack of chronic conditions and focus on healthy living.

Pulaski is lucky to still have a hospital, though. Southern states — and Tennessee especially — have seen rural hospitals close faster than anywhere else in the country. It’s a phenomenon routinely blamed on the lack of Medicaid expansion, which leaves many people uninsured.

“I get it,” DeeAnn said. “But that doesn’t mean they get to take advantage of the people going through there.”

The Takeaway: It is a national tragedy that many Americans avoid or defer needed medical care because of fear of costs. Still, there are steps you can take to protect yourself.

Emergency rooms are expensive places, so think twice before using them — although, in many circumstances, they are the only option on nights and weekends, particularly in rural areas.

Don’t be reassured by a provider’s insistence that your insurance should cover treatment. If you have a high-deductible plan, “you’re covered” doesn’t mean much because you’re responsible for — in Jason’s case — the first $8,000 in charges. Also, even if your insurer, in theory, covers your medical encounter, you may receive big bills from doctors outside your network or be required to contribute a hefty coinsurance share under the terms of your plan.

You can ask whether the self-pay cash price is an option — thereby waiving your insurance. But many facilities will require those who have insurance to use it — knowing they can bill higher prices that way.

If a physician gives you the option of having a lab test, MRI or X-ray on the spot in the ER versus doing it once you’re discharged, choose the latter. Tests run while in the ER are often many times more expensive than elsewhere. After your visit, check how it was coded. If the bill says Level 4 or 5 and the visit was fairly simple, ask more questions. Here’s a handy chart with descriptions of the five CPT (current procedural terminology) codes for the levels of ER service.

Finally, it’s worth knowing in advance who staffs the emergency departments of hospitals in your area, especially if you have a high-deductible plan. Are the doctors employed by the hospital or are they employed by a private-equity-owned staffing firm? The latter type of arrangement, research shows, often means high prices and more aggressive billing. Driving a few extra miles could save thousands of dollars.

74,"Britain on Saturday announced tougher entry rules for all arriving passengers and the return of a masks mandate, after confirming its first two cases of the new Omicron strain of Covid-19.

The cases were both linked to travel from southern Africa, and the government also expanded travel restrictions on the region with the addition of four countries to a ""red list"".

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said face masks would again be required in shops and on public transport, after controversially ditching the mandate in July when he reopened the UK economy after a prior nationwide lockdown.

He signalled no new lockdown now, vowing a review of the new measures in three weeks and expressing hope that Britons could look forward to a more festive Christmas than last year.

""But we now need to go further and implement a proportionate testing regime for arrivals from across the whole world,"" Johnson told a hastily arranged news conference, hours after the government confirmed the first two Omicron cases.

""So we are not going to stop people travelling... but we will require anyone who enters the UK to take a PCR test by the end of the second day after their arrival, and to self-isolate until they have a negative result,"" he said.

Currently, all Britons and foreigners entering the UK are required to take a PCR test on day two after their arrival.

The new rules add the requirement for isolation pending a negative result, significantly toughening the regime, in a bid to curb the spread of the new strain.

""I very much hope that we will find that we continue to be in a strong position and we can lift these measures again,"" Johnson said. ""But right now this is a responsible course of action.""

Downing Street said the new testing regime and masks mandate would enter into force ""next week"", along with a requirement for all contacts of suspected Omicron cases to self-isolate, regardless of their vaccination status.

And effective early Sunday, the government said it was placing another four African countries on its travel ban -- Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Angola.

Britain has already said it is banning travel from six southern African nations because of the emergence of Omicron: South Africa, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Zimbabwe and Botswana.

""After overnight genome sequencing, the UK Health Security Agency has confirmed that two cases of Covid-19 with mutations consistent with B.1.1.529 (Omicron) have been identified in the UK,"" a government statement said.

""The two cases are linked and there is a link to travel to southern Africa,"" it said.

One case was detected in the central English city of Nottingham, and the other in Chelmsford east of London, officials said.

""We have moved rapidly and the individuals are self-isolating while contact tracing is ongoing,"" Health Secretary Sajid Javid said.

The government was widely criticised for its travel and quarantine policy earlier in the pandemic, when it kept borders open to foreign travellers even as infection rates spiralled.

""This is a stark reminder that we are not yet out of this pandemic,"" Javid said, urging the public to get follow-up booster jabs of vaccines.

Johnson said he planned to expand the programme for booster vaccine shots, with the hope that government scientists will agree a government request to shorten the time-frame between second and third jabs, which is currently set at six months."
75,"Portage County Courthouse in Ravenna, Ohio

A man sentenced to spend the rest of his life in prison for raping and sexually assaulting an 8-year-old girl in Ravenna in 2017 has lost an appeal of his conviction.

According to an opinion filed this week, the 11th District Court of Appeals affirmed the August 2020 conviction of Daniel A. Mugrage, 33, in Portage County Court of Common Pleas.

According to trial testimony, the girl’s mother took the girl to Mugrage’s Ravenna apartment in July 2017, where the girl was told to place her hand on her mother’s hand while it was on Mugrage’s penis. The girl testified that during the night, Mugrage raped her. A jury convicted Mugrage of all four counts in a grand jury indictment, including first-degree felony rape, second-degree felony sexual battery and two counts of third-degree felony gross sexual imposition.

During his September 2020 sentencing hearing, Mugrage claimed innocence, but Judge Becky Doherty sentenced him to life in prison without possibility of parole plus an additional five years. According to Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction records, Mugrage is currently incarcerated in the Ross Correctional Institution.

According to the 35-page opinion, Mugrage claimed the common pleas court committed seven errors — all of which the appeals court found to be “without merit” — including:

• The court overruled a defense challenge to one juror, who said during jury selection that her daughter had been a victim of sexual abuse 15 years earlier. The opinion says that the woman said she could nevertheless be fair and impartial and the defense did not effectively demonstrate otherwise.

• The defense filed a motion requesting that the prosecution be barred from presenting evidence of “salacious photographs and communications” between Mugrage and the girl’s mother while he was incarcerated following the girl’s rape for failing to register as a sex offender in connection with a 2006 guilty plea to gross sexual imposition involving a then-16-year-old girl. The defense argued that the communications during his incarceration, which the court conceded was irrelevant to the rape case, were also irrelevant because they did not include direct evidence in the rape case.

Story continues

However, according to the opinion, the communications included Mugrage allegedly proposing future sexual activity between himself and the girl and her mother and photos of the girl and other girls were provided to Mugrage by the mother at Mugrage’s request. The mother then reported the communications to Garrettsville police a little over a year after the incidents in his apartment and this started the investigation resulting in the rape case, making the communications relevant to that case.

• The court overruled defense motions that there was insufficient evidence of rape due to offense going unreported for more than a year, of sexual battery because Mugrage did not have the responsibilities of a parent, and of gross sexual imposition since the girl had her hand on her mother’s hand, not on Mugrage’s penis.

The opinion states that delayed reporting does not qualify as insufficient evidence, though it could call the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of evidence into question. The opinion also says that “skin-to-skin touching” is not necessary in a charge of gross sexual imposition. The sexual battery charged ended up being merged into one of the gross sexual imposition charges and was not a factor in sentencing, the opinion says, and the guilty verdict was therefore “harmless” and the appeals court declined to address claim of insufficient evidence.

However, the opinion also says that the prosecution asserted that Mugrage’s relationship with the mother and his invitation to his home “triggered a duty of care for the child’s protection and support while in his home.”

• The jury’s verdict was not supported by the weight of evidence because the mother and girl both “lied and/or failed to disclose the incidents when initially questioned…”

The opinion says this does not mean the weight of evidence does not support the verdict, though it could raise questions about the credibility of witnesses. However, the opinion adds, the jury is “free to believe” the witnesses. The opinion also says that the mother’s fear of charges against herself and the girl’s fears of making her mother angry and getting her into trouble were reasonable explanations.

• Mugrage claimed his trial attorney did not attempt to have his trial delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The opinion, however, says Mugrage failed to demonstrate that delaying the trial would have resulted in a different outcome in the case.

• Mugrage claimed the court responded incorrectly when the jury, while deliberating the verdict, asked whether the girl’s hand on her mother’s hand constituted “sexual contact” and the court responded it did.

The opinion said the court’s answer to the question “was an accurate statement of the law.”

• The court erred by not granting a motion for a new trial due to the court allowing the prosecution to present the photo and communications evidence the defense considered irrelevant, as well as the issue of the defense attorney not seeking a delay in the trial.

The opinion says that because the appeals court had already found these claims to be without merit, this last claimed error is also without merit.
