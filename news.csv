0,0,0,1,Coast Guard swimmer pulls body from car above Niagara Falls,SFGate,US,"['rescue', 'water', 'swimmer', 'body', 'rapids', 'open', 'pulls', 'car', 'try', 'falls', 'coast', 'vehicle', 'niagara', 'guard']","(AP) — A U.S. Coast Guard helicopter crew braved poor visibility and frigid rapids to reach a car partly submerged in water near the brink of Niagara Falls, then lowered a rescue swimmer on a hoist who pulled out the woman trapped inside.

She did not survive.

Video from the harrowing rescue attempt showed Petty Officer 2nd Class Derrian Duryea, in an orange suit and with an axe in his left hand, buffeted by winds and spraying water as he was lowered 80 feet (24 meters) to the car through falling snow. After slowly spinning and swinging past the car, he was able to grab hold on the passenger side and open the door.

“As I was coming down I was just really focused on how am I going to get in this car when there’s, you know, pretty much rapids coming over the car right next to Niagara Falls,” Duryea said by phone later after returning to Selfridge Air National Guard Base, northeast of Detroit, where the crew is stationed. ”My sole focus was which window or door am I going in.""

“Luckily, the car was unlocked and I didn’t have to break out any windows and I was able to open up the passenger side door and push it up against the current,” he said.

Throughout the operation, the helicopter's pilot, Lt. Chris Monacelli, and flight mechanic Jon Finnerty kept a wary eye on the waterfall's icy mist as it coated the hovering aircraft, including the windows, further limiting what they could see.

“A lot of bigger planes have deicing capabilities, but we don’t,” Monacelli said. “We have a lot of discussions and training for what we'd do if we got into that situation because if you do accumulate enough ice on the helicopter, it will fall out of the sky.”

About two minutes after entering the car, with water surging around the vehicle and over the brink of the falls about 50 yards (45 meters) downstream, Duryea emerged and signaled for Finnerty to hoist him and the motionless driver, a woman in her 60s, from the water.

“The current was ripping pretty good through there and the car was close to the edge of the falls. If it moved, we didn’t want him getting dragged out with it,” Finnerty said.

It was unclear how the car got into the Niagara River. Witnesses reported seeing it floating near a pedestrian bridge, where it was believed to have gone in. Roads in the area were slippery.

Conditions in the air were no easier, with snow limiting visibility to a half mile for the Coast Guard crew that had assembled for a training flight at Lake St. Clair, Michigan, when they were dispatched to Niagara Falls, New York.

“At one point we were literally just flying down a street because we saw the road and we were trying to avoid the windmill farm that’s just west of Niagara,” Monacelli said. ”So we’re flying the road as these gigantic windmills are popping up like a half mile away from us.""

After the rescue, the car remained almost completely submerged, with only part of the roof and open trunk hatch visible, in the rapids upstream from the American Falls, one of three waterfalls that make up Niagara Falls. Onlookers watched as emergency crews prepared to try to pull the vehicle from the water.

Authorities said the driver lived in the area. Her name was not released pending notification of her relatives.

New York Park Police Capt. Christopher Rola said his department's swift-water rescue teams were unable to get to the car because of its location. Police had used a drone to determine it was occupied.

“It was an incredible job by the Coast Guard,” Rola said at a news conference. He said rescuers have never been called to a vehicle so close to the edge.

He said investigators would try to determine whether the vehicle wound up in the water by accident or intentionally.

1,1,1,2,Feds: Would-Be Terrorist Trained for Jihad at Texas Gun Range,Yahoo,US,"['enforcement', 'student', 'texas', 'range', 'gun', 'terrorist', 'prosecutors', 'wouldbe', 'trained', 'feds', 'ahmadou', 'allegedly', 'agents', 'travel', 'jihad', 'fbi', 'law']","Photo Illustration by Thomas Levinson/The Daily Beast/Getty; ABC News

When Navy sailors shot and killed a terrorist in the middle of an attack on a military base in Texas last year, the investigation seemed like it would be short-lived. The shooter, Adam Alsahli, was dead and there were no apparent accomplices in the attack.

But text messages sent by Alsahli on the morning of the attack have led the FBI to another Texas student whom law enforcement accuses of harboring extremist views. Over the past few months, prosecutors in Texas have sketched out Alsahli’s links to a criminal case involving an FBI informant, firearms training, and an alleged plan to travel to Gaza to wage “jihad.”

In July, federal prosecutors charged Moctar Gouroudja Ahmadou, a Nigerian immigrant who came to the U.S. on a student visa in 2016, with illegal possession of a firearm after an FBI surveillance team followed him to a Houston-area gun range and allegedly observed him firing handguns and an AR-15 assault rifle.

In court documents and a subsequent detention hearing, law enforcement painted a more dire picture of Ahmadou than the single gun charge would suggest. Ahamdou, law enforcement officials argued, was a danger to the community who had “expressed a desire to travel overseas for both education purposes and potentially for violent jihad.”

The charges against Ahmadou have not been reported and, to date, prosecutors have been reluctant to say much about the case. The Justice Department issued no press release about Ahmadou’s arrest and the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Houston did not respond to a request for comment.

Ahmadou’s attorneys also declined a request for comment but in court, public defender Philip Gallagher argued that his client had not “actually not discussed ever doing anything harmful to anyone within the United States” and that, despite at times 24-hour surveillance on Ahmadou by law enforcement, agents had little to show by way of a danger to the community from him.

Alsahli, a student who had expressed support for jihadist groups on social media, drove to the Naval base early one morning in May 2020 and shot at a guard before security personnel returned fire and killed him. No one was killed in the attack besides Alsahli and a ballistic vest saved the life of the sailor he shot in the chest.

Story continues

Ahmadou’s name first surfaced when FBI agents went through Alsahli’s phone in the wake of the Corpus Christi base shooting and found he’d sent a message to Ahmadou and a group of roughly eight people through the encrypted WhatsApp messaging app on the day of the attack.

FBI agents combing through Aslahi’s text and social media accounts learned that the two men, both studying in Texas colleges, had been in communication prior to the attack. Prosecutors say Ahmadou would text Alsahli Quranic verses and at one point had asked him through an intermediary about “an elephant in the room concerning jihad.” Ahmadou, an FBI agent testified during a recent detention hearing, “wanted to know if he needed parents’ permission to commit jihad.”

After the FBI learned of Ahmadou’s links to the Corpus Christi shooter, agents approached him through an unnamed “paid confidential source,” who secretly recorded conversations with the Nigerian man and reported on his activities to the FBI.

The recordings, detailed by law enforcement in court, allegedly show Ahamdou citing a speech by Anwar al-Awlak, an al Qaeda preacher killed in a U.S. drone strike in Yemen after he attracted a following of English-speaking extremists, calling for would-be jihadists to train with firearms as his motivation to learn more about guns.

Saudi Aviation Student Was Navy Air Base Shooter: Official

Agents also allegedly found Ahmadou downloaded sermons by ISIS spokesman Abu Mohammad al-Adnani, who issued a 2014 call for ISIS followers in the West to kill non-Muslims.

Throughout his conversations with the FBI’s informant, Ahmadou allegedly expressed a desire to “travel to Egypt, to Palestine, to Israel and Gaza,” particularly in May 2021 as fighting between Israeli forces and the terrorist group Hamas reached a peak in order “to study” and “travel to Gaza to possibly further commit violent jihad,” according to testimony from an FBI agent assigned to the case.

That month, Ahmadou allegedly traveled to a Houston-area gun range along with the FBI’s confidential source, where undercover FBI agents waiting at the range took photographs and observed him firing two hand guns and an AR-15 assault rifle, according to a criminal complaint.

Agents grew concerned, however, when Ahmadou allegedly expressed interest in receiving more intensive weapons training, including a sniper course and a training regimen that would teach him how to shoot targets while moving. Shortly afterwards, agents arrested Ahmadou and charged him with illegal possession of a firearm for his time at the firing range. Under federal law, non-immigrant visa holders are forbidden from possessing firearms.

Ahmadou has pleaded not guilty. A federal judge ruled him a potential flight risk and a possible danger to the community due to his foreign ties and alleged support of ISIS and ordered him detained pending a trial in January. Court records show the prosecutors requested a classification information security officer assigned to the case and that the prosecution will rely upon classified information to try the case.

When asked at a detention hearing in July whether Ahmadou had plans for any violence in the U.S., a FBI agent testified that the Bureau was “still investigating at this time.”

On Dec. 3, lawyers representing retired officer Kevin Betyeman, a Bridgewater resident, and Arizona resident James Bergstrom, husband of the late Celeste Andresen, agreed to the dismissal of the lawsuit in Somerset County Superior Court after the matter was settled out of court.

Bergstrom initially had sought damages under the Survivorship Act and Wrongful Death Act.

Kevin Betyeman

On Oct. 25, Betyeman, 57, a former sergeant with the Mountainside Police Department who retired in July 2019 after 25 years of service, was sentenced by Superior Court Judge Kathy Qasim in Somerville to 364 days in jail and five years probation on the third-degree charge of strict liability vehicular homicide, according to court records.

He also will lose his license for 12 months following his release.

EARLIER: Retired NJ police officer indicted in Raritan fatal pedestrian crash

Betyeman pleaded guilty to the charge Aug. 13.

On Sept. 18, 2020, Betyeman was driving a 2018 Chevrolet Silverado eastbound on Old York Road around 3:30 p.m. when his vehicle struck Celeste Andresen, 60, of San Manuel, Arizona, authorities said.

Andresen, who was visiting Raritan, was attempting to cross Old York Road near Woodmere Street in a well-marked crosswalk, according to the criminal complaint. She was about three-fourths of the way across the eastbound lane when she was struck.

Officers who arrived at the scene found a woman with life-threatening injuries. Police along with responding medical personnel initiated lifesaving measures at the scene before Andresen was transported to an area trauma center where she was pronounced dead.

Betyeman was arrested at the scene. His blood-alcohol concentration was above the legal limit of 0.08% BAC several hours after the collision, but he denied having consumed any alcohol or intoxicating substances when asked at the scene by police, authorities said.

He was initially charged with drunken driving, reckless driving, careless driving and failure to yield to a pedestrian. He was later charged with strict liability and third-degree hindering.

4,4,4,5,Israel closes probe of police who shot Palestinian attacker,ABCNews,World,"['probe', 'jerusalem', 'israeli', 'security', 'shot', 'east', 'palestinian', 'officers', 'closes', 'israel', 'shooting', 'wounded', 'attacker']","Israel’s Justice Ministry says it is closing an investigation into two police officers who shot dead a Palestinian assailant as he lay on the ground

TEL AVIV, Israel -- Israel’s Justice Ministry said Thursday it was closing an investigation into two police officers who shot dead a Palestinian assailant as he lay on the ground, accepting the officers’ assertion that they acted in self-defense.

A Palestinian attacker on Saturday stabbed and wounded an ultra-Orthodox Jew outside Jerusalem's Old City. He then tried to stab the officers before being shot and falling to the ground. Video footage showed a paramilitary Border Police officer shooting the attacker when he was already lying on the ground.

The shooting prompted calls for an investigation and drew comparisons to a 2016 incident in which an Israeli soldier was caught on camera shooting a wounded Palestinian attacker who was lying on the ground.

The Justice Ministry said it made its decision to close the case following the questioning of the two officers, who said they acted in self-defense.

“It was an incident that took place over mere seconds, in circumstances in which there was a real and concrete threat to the lives of the fighters and the civilians in the area,” it said in a statement. “It was found to be legally justified to use a weapon.”

The incident came amid an uptick in Israeli-Palestinian violence in Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank. On Wednesday, an Israeli woman was stabbed and lightly wounded in a tense neighborhood in east Jerusalem. The suspect, a Palestinian female minor, fled the scene and was later arrested inside a nearby school, police said.

Last month, a Hamas militant opened fire in Jerusalem’s Old City, killing one Israeli and wounding four others before being fatally shot by police.

Israel captured east Jerusalem in the 1967 war along with the West Bank and Gaza. Israel annexed east Jerusalem in a move not recognized internationally and considers the entire city its capital. The Palestinians want east Jerusalem to be the capital of their future state, to include the West Bank and Gaza.

Palestinians and Israeli rights groups say Israeli security forces sometimes use excessive force in response to attacks, killing suspected assailants who could have been arrested or who posed no immediate threat to security forces.

Rights groups also say Israel rarely holds members of its security forces accountable for the deadly shootings of Palestinians. Investigations often end with no charges or lenient sentences, and in many cases witnesses are not summoned for questioning.

Israel says its security forces make every effort to avoid harming civilians and that it investigates alleged abuses.

In the widely publicized 2016 case, Israeli soldier Elor Azaria was caught on camera shooting a wounded Palestinian attacker who was lying on the ground. Azaria later served two-thirds of a 14-month sentence after being convicted of reckless manslaughter.

His case sharply divided Israelis. The military pushed for his prosecution, saying he violated its code of ethics, while many Israelis, particularly on the nationalist right, defended his actions.",,2021-12-09T10:28:00,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/israel-closes-probe-police-shot-palestinian-attacker-81646586,"Israel’s Justice Ministry says it is closing an investigation into two police officers who shot dead a Palestinian assailant as he lay on the ground TEL AVIV, Israel -- Israel’s Justice ...","[10, 35, 28]",discuss,"Israel’s Justice Ministry says it is closing an investigation into two police officers who shot dead a Palestinian assailant as he lay on the ground

That shift in expectations for lift-off to Q3 from Q4 next year was driven by persistently higher inflation and now brings economists' views almost in line with market pricing.

However, rising COVID-19 cases around the world and the emergence of the Omicron coronavirus variant, along with renewed restrictions in some countries underscore that the pandemic is not yet over.

Still, the Dec. 3-8 poll predicted the Fed would raise rates by 25 basis points to 0.25-0.50% in Q3 2022, followed by three more hikes - in Q4 next year and Q1 and Q2 of 2023. The fed funds rate was expected to reach 1.25-1.50% by end-2023.

""We currently have September and December rate hikes in our forecast, but if scientific evidence suggests we are not entering a darker period for the pandemic we would imagine three hikes is far more likely,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING.

SLOW JOB GROWTH IN NOVEMBER UNLIKELY TO KEEP INTEREST RATES LOW, ECONOMISTS SAY

The timing shift to the third quarter of next year was also underpinned by Fed Chair Jerome Powell saying the central bank would discuss in December whether to end its $120 billion in monthly bond purchases a few months sooner than anticipated. Previous expectations were for it to end in mid-2022.

More than 60% of respondents to an additional question, 22 of 35, said the program would end by March. More than 80% of respondents, 30 of 36, said the risk to the timing of the first hike in this cycle was that it comes earlier.

Sixteen said a hike could come in the second quarter of 2022 and five said it could come as early as next quarter. Just a month ago only five economists said the Fed should hike in Q2 next year and four said Q1.

FED'S POWELL PLEDGES FASTER TAPERING TIMELINE WON'T 'DISRUPT' MARKETS

""We are penciling in the first hike in June, but with a risk it happens as early as March. It is a very close call, but we want to wait to see more data, including the impact of Omicron on the economy,"" said Ethan Harris, global economist at Bank of America Securities.

Economists were split on the biggest downside risk to the U.S. economy next year with 18 of 36 saying new coronavirus variants and 15 choosing high inflation.

Participants in the poll expect the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the Fed's key inflation gauge, to stay above 4% this quarter and next - double the 2% target - before slowing in the second half of 2022 along with growth.

Those forecasts were largely unchanged from last month, underlining the fact persistent price pressure remains a challenge for the Fed, and most other major central banks.

""Reduced demand for virus-sensitive services such as travel could have a disinflationary impact in the near term, but prior virus waves suggest that such pressures would be temporary and reverse as demand recovers,"" noted Joseph Briggs, economist at Goldman Sachs.

The 2015 launch presciently anticipated the coming rise in mobile banking, and six years later the Radnor, Pennsylvania-based business merged with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in a transaction worth $150 million. That made Sidhu the youngest female founder and CEO ever to take a company public at the time, and led her to even grander goals: Still at the helm of the company--now called BM Technologies--she says she wants to ""create ripple effects and inspire other women."" Here's why you should put your money on her to do just that.

The digital banking market is pretty crowded these days. Your company is on pace for nearly $100 million in revenue in 2021. How does BM Technologies succeed there?

We have a direct-to-consumer strategy, but we also allow nonbanks and large brands to launch their own digital banks--so we're essentially B2B2C. We have higher education institutions as our clients, allowing us to reach one in every three college-bound students. In all, we have about two million account holders, and we're one of the first neo-banking fintech firms to be profitable.

How did you know it was time to go public?

We were incubated by a larger bank and always knew we'd have to divest from it. We were open to many options, whether that was going public or a merger. We were getting close to a strategic merger, but then Covid hit and it didn't come to fruition. Soon after that, we started talking with a fintech-focused SPAC that was looking for an opportunity to play in this space. It was the right timing. It felt like destiny.

Why did you ultimately decide a SPAC listing was the right move, as opposed to a traditional IPO?

SPACs provide an efficient way of going public--the whole process took only about eight months. You also have an investor that knows your space, which can help get you a strong valuation up front. That said, you should already be profitable or close to it, and not just have projections that you'll be making money five years from now. A lot of the early companies that went public through SPACs had that trajectory, and that's why SPACs have a negative name to some people right now. Over time, there's going to be an understanding that this is for the players that actually have strong fundamentals.

The family of Ki'Anthony Tyus filed a wrongful death lawsuit against a Metro Louisville police officer after the 2018 crash, WDRB-TV reported.

The suit accused the officer, Roger Marcum, of improperly participating in a high-speed chase of a stolen SUV. The lawsuit said Marcum slammed his cruiser into the SUV, causing the crash.

Police said that the driver of the SUV lost control, flipped and crashed into a ditch. Five people were inside.

Attorney Sam Aguiar, who filed the lawsuit on behalf of Tyus' family, confirmed the settlement was reached earlier this year.

Last month, investigators discovered the grave close to a wood off the road linking the towns of Vukovar and Vinkovci. Work on the site is still going on as two thirds of some 15,000 square metres have yet to be searched through.

""We believe we will soon have the identification procedure completed for those 11 people,"" said Ivona Paltrinieri, who heads the department for missing people in the war veterans ministry.

The site near the village of Bobota is the 151st mass grave found in Croatia. Out of 5,204 exhumed bodies, some 4,300 people have been identified.

""For our identification method, based on a DNA analysis, we keep DNA data of about 10,000 people who seek their missing relatives. We have so far identified around 83% of the exhumed people,"" said Milovan Kubat, an expert at the Zagreb forensic identification centre.

According to official data, Croatia is still trying to establish the fate of 1,852 missing people.

Marija Sestan from Vukovar, which was reduced to rubble by Yugoslav army and Serb paramilitary units after a three-month siege in late 1991, is searching for his son Tomislav who was 21-years-old when he went missing.

""He was captured on Nov. 19, 1991. The last information I have about him is that he was taken by bus to nearby Borovo Selo. You can imagine how it is to wake up each day for 30 years hoping it would be a day when you might get some indication about what happened to him,"" she said.

Paltrinieri said the investigators were facing two major obstacles when trying to locate the sites of mass graves.

""In the last five years we investigated 264 locations and the success is at around 20%. A huge problem is that we don't receive concrete information from Serbia which would enable us locate the sites with more precision,"" she said.

Also, some tips and information received from individuals turn out to be misleading, she said.

According to the International Commission for Missing Persons (ICMP), some 11,000 people are still unaccounted for from the Balkan conflicts in the 1990s which broke out as the former Yugoslavia disintegrated into separate entities in the 1990s. Most are in Bosnia.

13,13,13,14,EXPLAINER: What will jurors hear about Daunte Wright?,Houston Chronicle,US,"['warrant', 'person', 'explainer', 'potter', 'spark', 'arrest', 'wrights', 'testimony', 'evidence', 'wright', 'case', 'hear', 'daunte', 'jurors']","MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Jurors at the manslaughter trial for the former suburban Minneapolis police officer who said she mistakenly drew her handgun when she fatally shot Daunte Wright will hear testimony about the kind of person he was – within limits.

Prosecutors at the trial of Kim Potter, 49, intend to call Wright’s father to testify in an attempt to humanize Wright for the jury. But the defense will seek to portray Wright as a lawless person who had pending criminal charges against him, and will argue his own actions contributed to his death.

Potter, who is white, is charged with first- and second-degree manslaughter in the April 11 shooting of Wright, a Black motorist, in the suburb of Brooklyn Center. Potter has said she meant to use her Taser – but grabbed her handgun instead – after Wright tried to drive away as officers were trying to arrest him.

Just how much of Wright’s past the jury gets to hear will depend in part on what Potter knew at the time of the attempted arrest, under a pretrial ruling from Judge Regina Chu.

Wright's past ""is irrelevant if she didn’t know about it,"" said Mike Brandt, a Minneapolis-area defense attorney who is not connected to the case. ""It doesn’t go into the calculus of — was it reasonable,” he said.

Prosecutors intend to call Wright’s father, Arbuey Wright, to the stand as they near the end of their case to present testimony under the “spark of life” doctrine. Such testimony designed to humanize a victim is barred in most states. But it’s allowed in Minnesota under a 1985 Supreme Court ruling that found prosecutors can present evidence that a murder victim was “not just bones and sinews covered with flesh, but was imbued with the spark of life.”

Wright's mother, Katie Bryant, provided some spark of life testimony on Wednesday, saying her son loved to play basketball and was a jokester, and was thinking about pursuing carpentry. She said Wright’s son, Daunte Jr., was born early at 28 weeks and while the baby was hospitalized, Wright fed him with a Q-tip, dipped in milk.

She said Wright, 20, was proud to be a father, but also worried because the boy was premature. “He was an amazing dad.""

The two sides have pushed and pulled over what should be allowed in “spark of life” evidence. Potter's attorneys objected to five photos the prosecution wanted to introduce; Chu ruled that three would be admitted.

That spark-of-life evidence is not the only way in which the two sides will seek to sway jurors.

In opening statements, prosecutor Erin Eldridge showed a photo of Wright with the 1-year-old son he left behind. She mentioned how he once wanted to be a pro basketball player. She said he had just been given the family car to use as his own, and was taking it to be washed when he was pulled over — prompting him to call his mother. Eldridge repeatedly called him “scared” and a “kid.”

The defense used part of their opening statement to begin building an unsavory picture of Wright, starting with police smelling marijuana in his car, his lack of a license and valid insurance and an outstanding warrant for his arrest on a weapons charge. Potter's trainee partner that day, Officer Anthony Luckey, had found the warrant when he ran a records check.

Court records show the warrant had been issued just days earlier after Wright failed to appear in court on charges from a June 2020 incident in Minneapolis. In that case, authorities alleged he had a pistol without a permit in a public place — a gross misdemeanor, punishable by no more than a year in prison — and that he ran away from officers, a misdemeanor punishable by up to 90 days behind bars.

It’s not clear if Potter knew the exact details of the warrant.

Luckey testified that he found there was also an order for protection against Wright, which told him that Wright was not to have contact with a certain woman, but did not say why.

Joseph Daly, professor emeritus at Mitchell Hamline School of Law in St. Paul, said the warrant itself is highly relevant, because that’s the reason Wright was being arrested instead of just ticketed. The precise reason for the arrest might be questionable, he said.

“It comes down to, what relevance does this have in relationship to explaining why they are trying to arrest this guy,” he said.

Prosecutors say Potter had no knowledge of Wright’s prior criminal charges. If that’s the case, jurors likely won’t hear that Wright was charged with aggravated robbery after a 2019 arrest for allegedly demanding money from a woman at gunpoint, choking her and trying to pull the money from under her bra, where she had placed it, according to the complaint.

The matter was pending at the time of Wright’s death.

Defense attorneys have also asked the court to admit other allegations against Wright into evidence. Chu has ruled that a photo of Wright holding a gun will not be admitted.

Chu said alleged drug use by Wright may be relevant to explain his actions on April 11, and his possession of drugs would be relevant only if Potter was aware of it at the time of the shooting. Court testimony so far has indicated she was — as Luckey testified that he smelled marijuana in the car and saw marijuana residue on the center console.

Daly said any good or bad details that come out about Wright shouldn't matter when it comes to the charges against Potter.

“If you think it through, it’s really irrelevant whether the person was a saint or a sinner,” he said, adding: “You murder the worst person in the world, he’s still a victim and it’s a crime. You can’t take the law into your own hands … even the worst person has a right to life.”

The announcement comes after an investigation by the Los Angeles Times revealed a history of discriminatory text messages reportedly sent between what it says were at least a dozen current and former Torrance police officers and recruits, including a photo of Black men being lynched with the caption ""hanging with the homies.""

Another text message conversation included a photo asking what someone should do if their girlfriend was having an affair with a Black man, the newspaper reported. According to the officer's caption, the answer was to break ""a tail light on his car so the police will stop him and shoot him.""

The LA Times report also references records from the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office that said TPD officers made offensive jokes about Jewish people and threatened to assault members of the LGBTQ community.

CNN has reached out to the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office to confirm the validity of those documents.

The LA Times reports that its investigation of use-of-force records and other court filings also revealed the same Torrance police officers who allegedly sent racist text messages were involved in at least seven use-of-force incidents since 2013. It reported that documents show three of those incidents resulted in the deaths of Black and Latino men, sparking outcry and numerous community calls to reexamine those cases.

The state independent investigation will help ""identify and correct potential systemic failures in the department's policies and practices"" and is an effort to ""rebuild trust"" between the public and the Torrance Police Department, Bonta said, adding that communities deserve equal justice.

""Police departments are on the front lines of that fight every day as they work to protect the people of our state,"" Bonta said in a statement. ""However, where there is evidence of potentially pervasive bias or discrimination, it can undermine the trust that is critical for public safety and our justice system.""

The California DOJ is working closely with the Torrance police chief, who had asked for the attorney general's help.

""As Police Chief of the Torrance Police Department, I am committed to accountability, and I will not tolerate any form of bigotry, racism, hate, or misconduct,"" Torrance Chief of Police Jay Hart said in a statement.

While no TPD officers currently face criminal charges for the racist text messages, prosecutors said they will continue to investigate previous and ongoing cases the officers have been involved in, the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office told the LA Times.

Torrance is a city of around 143,000 people in the Los Angeles metropolitan area.

In a memo dated Tuesday, Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro said “corrective actions shall be performed as expeditiously as possible.”

The Navy previously said it was suspending use of the massive fuel storage complex near Pearl Harbor following days of complaints that tap water smells like fuel and has sickened some people.

But the Navy also informed Hawaii officials it was contesting a state order demanding that the suspension remain in effect until independent evaluators can ensure that appropriate actions are taken to protect drinking water.

State officials want the Navy to treat contaminated drinking water and remove fuel from the massive 20 underground storage tanks at the complex called the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility.

Kaitlin Arita-Chang, a spokesperson for the Hawaii Department of Health, said she was seeking comment from state officials about the memo.

The Navy will consult with an independent third party to assess operations and system integrity of the tank facility and develop a plan for necessary repairs, said the memo, which was made public Wednesday.

Three adult teens have been arrested on arson charges for allegedly starting a fire in Montana that destroyed 13 homes, authorities said.

The Gibson Flats Fire started in the early morning hours of December 1 and spread rapidly due to high winds, according to Cascade County Sheriff Jesse Slaughter.

Early investigations showed that two fires were set, and a nearby residential surveillance video placed the teens' vehicle in the area where one of the fires began.

The suspects -- identified by police as Galvinn Munson, Jevin McLean and Brandon Bennett Jr. -- were interviewed by detectives who found they were smoking marijuana and setting off fireworks at each other in the vehicle that night, Slaughter said.

Global regulatory scrutiny of tech giants has been increasing after a string of scandals over privacy and misinformation, as well as complaints from some businesses that they abuse their market power.

As well as Amazon, Alphabet's Google, Facebook Inc, Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp have drawn heightened scrutiny in Europe.

AMAZON OUTAGE DISRUPTS LIVES, SURPRISING PEOPLE ABOUT THEIR CLOUD DEPENDENCY

Italy's watchdog said in a statement that Amazon had leveraged its dominant position in the Italian market for intermediation services on marketplaces to favour the adoption of its own logistics service - Fulfilment by Amazon (FBA) - by sellers active on Amazon.it.

The authority said Amazon tied to the use of FBA access to a set of exclusive benefits, including the Prime label, that help increase visibility and boost sales on Amazon.it.

""Amazon prevents third-party sellers from associating the Prime label with offers not managed with FBA,"" it said.

The Prime label makes it easier to sell to the more than 7 million most loyal and high-spending consumers members of Amazon’s loyalty program.

The round, led by DCVC, brings the robotics company’s funding up to $33 million, with additional participation from ACME Capital Congruent Ventures, 8VC, Real Ventures, Elementum Ventures and Mac Venture Capital.

“We’ve invented a completely new way to excavate rock and this will have profound implications on the future of tunneling,” co-founder and CEO Kim Abrams said in release tied to the news. “By delivering a boring solution that affordably undergrounds utilities through high-grade rock, we can finally protect communities from exposure to wildfires and ensure the safety of critical infrastructure in disaster-prone areas, especially in places like the Sierra Nevada mountains, Rocky Mountains, and coastal regions.”

The news arrives as the company is announcing a successful pilot of its robot, Swifty. According to the firm, the robot successfully bored a 20-foot tunnel through Sioux Quartzite at a rate of one inch-per-minute. The metamorphic rock is notoriously hard, making it a popular choice for buildings in the upper Midwest region in which it is found. That strength, however, also makes it a formidable challenge from infrastructure and other projects that require tunneling.

“No tunneling method has been able to tunnel through this kind of hard rock until now. Petra’s achievement is due to Swifty’s thermal drilling method, which efficiently bores through rock without touching it,” said Tesla co-founder, Ian Wright, who has signed on as the company’s CTO. “Boring 20 feet through impossibly hard Sioux Quartzite proves our unique capability to affordably bury utility sized tunnels through high-grade hard rock.”

The robotic system utilizes machine vision, microtunneling through difficult materials with the use of thermal drilling, rather than making direct contact with the rock. The company notes in a release, “Switfy provides a number of novel advantages over conventional microtunneling methods. Conventional microtunneling machines are purpose-built for a single diameter. However, Swifty is the first robot capable of boring a range of diameters between 20-60 inches, dramatically reducing the cost of tunneling.”

GENEVA, Dec 9 (Reuters) - The World Health Organization's (WHO) vaccine advisory panel recommends that people who are immunocompromised or received an inactivated vaccine should receive a booster dose of a COVID-19 shot, the head of the panel said on Thursday.

The recommendation comes after the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on immunisation held a meeting on Tuesday to evaluate the need for COVID-19 boosters.

Speaking in a briefing, SAGE chair Alejandro Cravioto said emerging data showed that vaccines' efficacy against COVID-19 wanes, with a significant decline seen in older people in particular.

Inactivated vaccines which take the SARS-CoV-2 virus and inactivate or kill it using chemicals, heat or radiation, are made by Chinese manufacturers Sinovac Biotech (SVA.O), state-owned Sinopharm and India's Bharat Biotech.

A single dose of the Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) vaccine is still effective, but data from the company's clinical trials using two doses clearly show the benefit of having further vaccination, Cravioto said.

Being president of an almost evenly divided U.S. Senate has paid off in at least one way for Vice President Kamala Harris: She has now surpassed predecessor Mike Pence in casting tie-breaking votes.

On Wednesday, Harris cast a pair of votes in helping the Senate confirm Rachael Rollins to be a new U.S. attorney in Massachusetts, giving Harris her 14th and 15th tie-breaking votes since taking office last January, The Hill reported.

""Every time I vote, we win,"" Harris was quoted as saying to NBC News.

VP HARRIS MEETS WITH ACTIVIST WHO SAID ‘F--- WHITE WOMEN’

Pence totaled 13 tie-breaking Senate votes over four years as vice president under former President Donald Trump, but Harris has exceeded that total in less than one year.

The current Senate is split between 50 Republicans and 48 Democrats, with two independents caucusing with the Democrats to create a 50-50 split on some votes, requiring Senate President Harris to step in.

Other close votes have sometimes seen moderate Democrats, such as U.S. Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia or Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, side with their GOP colleagues, making a tie-breaker unnecessary.

Most of Harris’ deciding votes have been linked to confirmation of Biden appointees to administration positions, The Hill reported.

Harris now ranks fifth among vice presidents for deciding votes. The leaders all served in the 18th or 19th centuries: John Calhoun (31); John Adams (29); George Dallas (19); and Schuyler Colfax (18) each have more than Harris.

Amazon holds a position of ""absolute dominance"" in the Italian brokerage services market, ""which has allowed it to promote its own logistics service, called Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA),"" the authority wrote in a (Google translated) press release.

According to the AGCM, companies must use Amazon's FBA service if they want access to key benefits like the Prime label, which in turn allows them to participate in Black Friday sales and other key events. ""Amazon has thus prevented third-party sellers from associating the Prime label with offers not managed with FBA,"" it said.

The authority said access to those functions are ""crucial"" for seller success. It also noted that third-party sellers using FBA are not subject to the same stringent performance requirements as non-FBA sellers. As such, they're less likely to be suspended from the platform if they fail to meet certain goals. Finally, it noted that sellers using Amazon's logistics services are discouraged from offering their products on other online platforms, at least to the same extent they do on Amazon.

The AGCM said it imposed the steep fine as it considered Amazon's actions to be ""particularly serious"" given their duration and the effects they've caused. On top of the fine, it has demanded that Amazon grant the privileges enjoyed by FBA sellers to all third-party sellers, provided they respect other rules and laws. It will have to define and publish those standards within a year, and its actions will be enforced by a monitoring trustee.

In a statement to Engadget, an Amazon spokesperson said the company ""strongly disagreed"" with the decision and will appeal. It also noted that non-FBA sellers can use its Seller Fulfilled Prime (SFP) service, which gives them access to Prime benefits without having to use Amazon’s logistics services.

We strongly disagree with the decision of the Italian Competition Authority (ICA) and we will appeal. The proposed fine and remedies are unjustified and disproportionate. More than half of all annual sales on Amazon in Italy come from SMBs, and their success is at the heart of our business model. Small and medium-sized businesses have multiple channels to sell their products both online and offline: Amazon is just one of those options. We constantly invest to support the growth of the 18,000 Italian SMBs that sell on Amazon, and we provide multiple tools to our sellers, including those who manage shipments themselves.

Last month, Amazon and Apple were fined $228 million in Italy for unfairly restricting Beats sales by limiting them to select retailers. The EU also handed Amazon a record $888 million fine for violating the bloc's strict GDPR data privacy laws. Other tech giants are also under scrutiny in the EU.

NO SMOKING? NO PROBLEM! (1025 GMT)

It's fair to say that New Zealand's plan to forbid youngsters from ever buying cigarettes, clearly one of the world's toughest crackdowns on the deadly habit, hasn't sent tobacco shares in nicotine withdrawal convulsions this morning.

Register now for FREE unlimited access to reuters.com Register

British American Tobacco, Imperial Brands, and Swedish Match are cruising up between 0.2% and 0.7% with little sense that the Kiwi legislation could be the beginning of the end for the industry.

There are many reasons for that.

According to Citi analysts, New Zealand only represents 1% to 2% of the earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of British American Tobacco and Imperial.

Secondly, they stress strict smoking rules typically take a long time to pass into law and implement.

Thirdly, well, smoking is probably doomed in the long run anyway.

Citi analysts believe that ""tradition cigarette consumption will continue to decline and that the last smoker may quit by 2050"".

Why then hold these tobacco stocks, which so many ESG funds wouldn't touch with a barge pole?

Looking at British American Tobacco and Imperial Brands' 8% dividend yields provides some kind of an answer.

The trend in vaping is another answer.

""Our clear preference for stocks which are transitioning to reduced-risk-products and hence we re-iterate our core positive stances on both Philip Morris and BATS"", the Citi analysts say.

STOXX ON THE UP, VOLATILITY EASES FURTHER (0902 GMT)

European shares are off to a slightly positive start as good news on vaccine efficacy against Omicron reassured investors, helping put a key euro zone volatility gauge on course for its fourth straight day of declines.

So while the pan-regional STOXX 600 (.STOXX) equity benchmark index was up 0.2% in early deals, euro STOXX volatility (.V2TX) dipped below 23 points, widening the distance from the post-Omicron peak to more than 10 points.

Sectoral moves were muted with gains in consumer staples and healthcare more than offsetting weaker banks and energy stocks.

LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE (0816 GMT)

England is going under tougher COVID-19 curbs, Christmas parties are being cancelled across Europe and the United States, and Jefferies became the first big Wall Street bank to send employees home.

But markets are looking on the bright side -- news that a three-shot course of BioNTech/Pfizer's vaccine neutralised the Omicron virus variant in a laboratory test enabled stock markets to carry on merrily higher on Wednesday.

Even S&P 500's airlines index managed to recoup pre-Omicron highs. (.SPCOMAIR).

But with focus returning to central banks and inflation, the rally has lost some of its edge. European and U.S. futures are flatlining, Japanese stocks fell 0.3% and a global equity index paused near two-week highs.

Chinese factory gate prices at 12.9%, had eased only slightly from 26-year highs touched in October, data showed on Thursday. read more

Elevated factory prices eventually feed into CPI which ticked up to 2.3% in November, from last month's 1.5%. Authorities fixed the yuan a touch below the three-year highs hit on Wednesday but the inflation worry will limit how much it can weaken.

China's data sets the stage for Friday's U.S. CPI, which some participants in this week's Reuters monthly summit predicted would print with ""a 7-handle"". Core inflation could be above 5%, some reckon.

It will be the last key piece of data before the December 14-15 Federal Reserve meeting, which could flag a step-up in the pace of policy tightening.

In neighbouring Canada, markets now see interest rates rising from 0.25%, after the central bank on Wednesday dropped a reference to inflationary forces as temporary.

Those inflation projections and the stock market rebound forced bond yields higher -- a three-day rise in 10-year Treasuries was their longest since mid-October. This morning, edgier equity markets have sent U.S. and German bond yields a touch lower and the dollar index is back at one-week highs.

And data never ceases to surprise. Germany just reported October export figures which grew 4.1%, the highest in over a year and beating expectations of a 0.9% gain read more

European shares look set for a timid bounce this morning as inventors weigh vaccine reassurances against new COVID-19 restrictions amid caution ahead of U.S. inflation data on Friday which could provide the Fed more ammunition for tighter policy.

Following yesterday's pull-back, futures on main regional benchmarks in Europe were up around 0.3%, with sentiment also helped by hopes for monetary easing in China.

U.S. stock futures were just below parity after gains yesterday on the back of data from BioNTech and Pfizer showing their vaccine shot offered some protection against the new Omicron variant.

STOXX ON THE UP, VOLATILITY EASES FURTHER (0902 GMT)

European shares are off to a slightly positive start as good news on vaccine efficacy against Omicron reassured investors, helping put a key euro zone volatility gauge on course for its fourth straight day of declines. U.S. stock futures were just below parity after gains yesterday on the back of data from BioNTech and Pfizer showing their vaccine shot offered some protection against the new Omicron variant."
28,28,28,29,Half of parents say their teen received COVID-19 shot as uptake slows: KFF poll,The Hill,Health,"['parents', 'covid19', 'vaccines', 'shot', 'children', 'child', 'slows', 'vaccinated', 'safety', 'uptake', 'received', 'vaccine', 'poll', 'olds', 'half', 'say', 'kff', 'teen']","About half of parents said their 12 to 17-year-old has gotten at least one COVID-19 dose as the vaccination uptake among the age group has slowed in recent months, a Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) poll found.

The November survey determined that 49 percent of parents said their 12 to 17 year olds received at least one shot, and just 1 percent of these parents plan to get their children vaccinated right away, according to an update to KFF’s Vaccine Monitor published on Thursday.

Those percentages align with results from September and October, indicating the vaccination rate has flattened within the teenage age group in the fall after eligibility expanded to adolescents in the spring.

Thirteen percent of parents of teenagers said they want to “wait and see” before getting them vaccinated, and three in 10 parents said their adolescents would “definitely not” get the COVID-19 vaccine.

Among parents with 5 to 11 year olds, 16 percent said their child had gotten at least their first shot during the first month the vaccines were available to the age group, while 13 percent said they plan to get their child vaccinated right away.

Still, almost a third of these parents said they expect to “wait and see,” and another 29 percent said their child will “definitely not” get vaccinated.



Liz Hamel, KFF’s vice president and director of public opinion and survey research, said the data indicates that parents are taking a “more cautious approach” to COVID-19 vaccines for their children.

“The younger the child, the more sort of caution we see in terms of parents’ approach,” she said.

“As we've seen with teens, I think with younger kids as well it's gonna take longer for parents to come around to the decision,” she said. “And I expect the uptake to be slower than it was among adults.”

Similar to adults, parents’ views on COVID-19 vaccinations for children are split among partisan lines.

Eighty percent of Democrats said their adolescent had gotten their shot, compared to almost half of independents and a quarter of Republicans. Half of Republicans said their 12 to 17-year-old will “definitely not” get their COVID-19 shots.

While a majority of parents see COVID-19 as a greater risk than the vaccine, 39 percent of parents of adolescents and 41 percent of parents of 5 to 11 year olds said the vaccine poses a bigger risk.

Americans have less confidence in the COVID-19 vaccines’ safety for children than for adults, with about half expressing confidence in their safety for adolescents and 43 percent saying the same for 5 to 11 year olds. Two-thirds of parents said they are confident in the vaccines’ safety for adults.

Most parents said there’s not enough information about the vaccines’ effectiveness, side effects and safety in children, despite scientific organizations nationwide and worldwide having designated the shots safe and effective for children.

But majorities of both vaccinated and unvaccinated parents said they have “a great deal” or “a fair amount” of trust in their child’s pediatrician to give information about the vaccine, although less than half of parents have consulted them about the shots.

KFF surveyed 1,196 parents between Nov. 8 and 23, with a margin of error of 5 percentage points.

KFF conducted the poll ahead of the emergence of the omicron strain that the World Health Organization has designated as a variant of concern, which researchers said could alter parents’ vaccination plans.

“Surges particularly in hospitalizations and deaths have in the past been a motivator for people to get vaccinated,” Hamel said. “But I think we just don't know what might be happening with this new variant yet.”",https://www.bing.com/th?id=OVFT.v7b2GVXZA_EFoKyn-M59JS&pid=News%height=393%width=700,2021-12-09T09:00:00,https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/584950-half-of-parents-say-their-teen-received-covid-19-shot-as-uptake-slowed-kff,"About half of parents said their 12 to 17-year-old has gotten at least one COVID-19 dose as the vaccination uptake among the age group has slowed in recent months, a Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) poll found.","[22, 8, 11]",discuss,"Among parents with 5 to 11 year olds, 16 percent said their child had gotten at least their first shot during the first month the vaccines were available to the age group, while 13 percent said they plan to get their child vaccinated right away.

The mandates were heralded as a way to help get America out of the Covid pandemic, but Biden now finds himself fighting for them — particularly the one that targets private businesses — on three fronts: in the judicial system, in Congress and in the court of public opinion.

The White House says it is prepared for the fight. A legal team has been assembled to wage the battle in the courts. Biden is prepared to veto any legislation that Congress might manage to pass to erode his mandates as bipartisan opposition grows. And he will keep talking to the public about his goals.

But the fight is only going to get harder, possibly compounded by the unknowns created by the omicron variant of the coronavirus and the growing complaints within Biden's own party.

""It’s good politics,"" a Democratic House member said of vaccination mandates. But the lawmaker lamented that ""some in the White House want to quietly walk away.""

Biden is gambling that the long-term value of defeating the disease — for Americans' health, the economy and his own standing — far outweighs short-term political considerations, said a White House aide and a strategist close to the administration, who asked to speak anonymously to detail internal thinking.

The official argued that vaccinations are “one of the best weapons we have against the virus” and that the persistence of the virus is fueling inflation and disrupting supply chains. The official said it’s “very unfortunate” that Republicans are “acting like lobbyists for the virus” and standing in the way of Biden’s plan to defeat it.

White House officials have said the mandates are already delivering the intended results, regardless of the recent political and legal challenges.

But that may further erode the ability to push back against the opposition — if the mandates have already convinced everyone who can be convinced, it's possible that more Democrats, and even the White House, will begin to conclude that the rules have served their purpose and that their usefulness has run out.

Publicly the White House says it will not back down from any challenges.

Two Senate Democrats — Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Jon Tester of Montana — voted with Republicans on Wednesday evening to nullify Biden's vaccination mandate for private businesses. The measure passed in a 52-48 vote.

Tester said he had repeatedly heard from small businesses ""about the negative effect the private business vaccine mandate will have on their bottom lines and our state’s economy,"" while Manchin argued that the government ""should incentivize, not penalize, private employers whose responsibility it is to protect their employees from Covid-19.""

It is unclear whether the bill would pass the Democratic-controlled House or even come up for a vote. But if it were to land on Biden's desk, he will veto it, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said.

The White House has also said Biden plans to continue to move forward with the mandates despite the number of recent court rulings challenging them. Officials have said they are confident in their legal ability to implement the mandates across the country.

Asked about the most recent ruling by a federal judge in Georgia blocking the administration from enforcing the mandate for federal contractors, Psaki said the Justice Department would ""vigorously defend"" the rule in court.

The mandates work, she argued, saying that 92 percent of federal employees have already been fully vaccinated with initial series of the vaccines and that big companies like Lockheed Martin have reported a more than 95 percent compliance rate. In the meantime, Psaki said, ""the president and the administration will continue pressing forward.""

It is not as clear how the administration plans to confront dipping poll numbers, especially as leaders like Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, voice some hesitancy over widespread mandates.

Christopher Wilson, a Republican strategist who was Virginia Gov.-elect Glenn Youngkin’s pollster, said that while polls generally have shown majority support for the mandate, the support is dropping.

Recent polls found approval ratings for mandates dipping, including a recent Wall Street Journal poll that found 50 percent support. That is down from the earlier polls that registered support as high as 58 percent approval this fall.

""When we've tested this in campaigns we've included the fact that employees who aren't vaccinated could lose their jobs or be forced to pay huge costs for weekly tests,"" Wilson said in an email. ""Filling in that side of the equation makes the mandate unpopular, particularly with minority voters.

""This is another example of the Democratic party embracing authoritarian governance, pushing large parts of their base away,"" he added.",https://www.bing.com/th?id=OVFT.J50teYpBYqeyBLzppBbO0C&pid=News%height=367%width=700,2021-12-09T09:31:00,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/white-house-braces-legal-political-showdown-over-vaccine-mandates-n1285635,Mounting Democratic and Republican criticism could further erode public support and make Biden's task more difficult.,"[50, 38, 52]",discuss,"White House officials have said the mandates are already delivering the intended results, regardless of the recent political and legal challenges.

Prepared Remarks:

Operator

Greetings, and welcome to GameStop's third quarter fiscal 2021 earnings conference call. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be archived for two months on GameStop's investor relations website. This call will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Any such statement should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements and the Safe Harbor statement in the earnings release and risk factors discussed in the reports filed with the SEC.

GameStop assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements or information. A reconciliation and other information regarding non-GAAP financial measures discussed on the call can be found in the company's earnings release issued earlier today, as well as the investor section of the GameStop website. Please note that the company will not be hosting a question-and-answer session as part of today's call. Now, I would like to turn the call over to the company's chief executive officer, Matt Furlong.

Matt Furlong -- Chief Executive Officer

Thank you. It's good to be with everyone. Before going over the quarter, I want to thank all our team members for continuing to bring tremendous focus and intensity to GameStop's mission. We continue to see a customer-first culture taking hold throughout our stores, fulfillment centers, and corporate offices.

Maintaining this emphasis on the customer will remain key as we work to grow across categories and new areas. During the quarter, we focused on expanding our selection, accelerating delivery speeds, and improving the customer experience. We also made long-term investments in our infrastructure, talent, and technology. We believe our emphasis on the long term is positioning us to build what will ultimately become a much larger business relative to where we are in 2021.

We've also been exploring emerging opportunities in blockchain, NFTs, and Web 3.0 gaming. With this context in mind, here are a few recent initiatives of note. We continued growing our catalog by adding new products across consumer electronics, PC gaming, and other categories with significant addressable markets. Some of the brands we've established new and expanded relationships with include Samsung, LG, Razer, Vizio, Logitech, and Asus just to name a few.

Sales attributable to these new and expanded brand relationships helped to drive growth in the quarter. We also began implementing new assortment strategies within our stores, including an expansion of PC gaming merchandise across approximately 60% of U.S. locations. With respect to hiring, we kept adding talent across the organization, including specialists with experience in e-commerce, UI/UX, blockchain, operations, and supply chain.

Over the course of 2021, we have made more than 200 senior hires from some of the top technology companies. We also recently added a new office in Seattle and have identified an office location in Boston, positioning us within two tech hubs with strong local talent markets. Having footprints in these cities will help us attract and retain tech-focused teams with expertise in e-commerce and other areas. Shifting gears to our fulfillment network, we've started shipping orders from Reno, Nevada while increasing shipments from York, Pennsylvania.

Our expanded network is continuing to help us improve shipping times to customers across the U.S. Additionally, we recently announced a plan to hire up to 500 associates at our new customer care facility in South Florida. The facility, which is now operational, will be a key part of our new U.S.-based customer care operation. Lastly, we've further strengthened our financial position by securing a new $500 million ABL facility, which closed early in November and includes improved liquidity and terms.

The facility provides reduced borrowing costs, lighter covenants, and more flexibility. Let me now turn to our financial results for the quarter. Net sales increased 29.1% to just under $1.3 billion, compared to just over $1 billion during the same period in 2020. As indicated in the past, long-term revenue growth is the primary metric by which we believe stockholders should assess our execution.

SG&A was $421.5 million, or 32.5% of sales, compared to $360.4 million or 35.9% of sales in last year's third quarter. We reported a net loss of $105.4 million, or $1.39 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $18.8 million or loss per diluted share of $0.29 in the prior-year third quarter. There were no one-time transformation, transaction, or related costs during the period. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of over $1.4 billion, nearly $1 billion higher than the end of the third quarter last year.

We continue to maintain a sizable cash position even while front-loading investments in inventory to meet heightened demand and mitigate the full impact of global supply chain issues. At the end of the quarter, we had no borrowings under our ABL facility and no debt other than a $46.2 million low-interest unsecured term loan associated with the French government's response to COVID-19. Total liabilities compared to the third quarter of last year were down $262.1 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $12.5 million, bringing year-to-date capex to $40.7 million.

We anticipate capex will continue to increase as we make pragmatic investments in our infrastructure and tech. In the third quarter, cash flow from operations was an outflow of $293.7 million, compared to an outflow of $184.6 million during the same period last year. In order to meet customer demand and drive sales growth amid the tight supply chain, we grew our inventory to $1.14 billion as of the close of the quarter, compared to $861 million at the close of the prior year's third quarter. In terms of our outlook, we're not providing formal guidance at this time.

Before wrapping up, I do want to quickly reinforce some key points about our go-forward operating philosophy. Our emphasis on the top line stems from our leadership team's significant e-commerce experience and belief that revenue growth is critical. We believe revenue growth will translate to scale and market leadership. And from there, scale and market leadership will translate to greater free cash flows over time.

Our focus on the long term means we will continuously prioritize growth and market leadership over short-term margins. I'll leave it there for this quarter. As always, we appreciate all the enthusiasm and support from our customers, employees, and stockholders who we believe are the best in the world. Thank you.

34,34,34,35,"Vivendi to Acquire Amber Capital’s Stake in Lagardere, Sets Takeover Bid in February 2022",Variety,Business,"['umg', '2022', 'takeover', 'acquire', 'arnaud', 'vivendi', 'capitals', 'sets', 'company', 'capital', 'stake', 'bid', 'lagardère', 'amber', 'voting', 'lagardere']","Vivendi, the parent company of Canal Plus Group, is set to acquire a 17.5% stake in Lagardere, the French media, publishing and travel retail conglomerate, from Amber Capital in the next few days.

Vivendi will own 45.1% of the Lagardère capital following the acquisition of 24.7 million shares at a price of €24.10 ($27.27) per share. The company said the transaction will not imply any cash transfers from either party, since Amber Capital will keep the funds received as cash collateral from Vivendi.

If approved by regulatory authorities, the transaction will place Vivendi above the 30% share capital and voting right threshold in Lagardere. That will trigger a full bid for the company, which Vivendi said it will make at the same price, in Feb. 2022. Other current shareholders in Lagardere include Arnaud Lagardere, as well as Qatar Holding and Financière Agache, the holding of LVMH president Bernard Arnault.

Following the deal, Vivendi will own 36.1% of the voting rights. But the company said it will wait to get the approval of the European Commission and other relevant anti-trust bodies next year to start exercising those voting rights.

Vivendi, which owned a 29% stake prior to the pending deal, began investing in Lagardere with a 10.6% stake in April 2020, when the company’s president Arnaud Lagardère, who inherited the illustrious banner from his father, Jean-Luc Lagardère, clashed with Amber Capital and was threatened to be pushed aside. The status of the company was recently changed to “société anonyme” (public limited company) and Arnaud Lagardere obtained an additional 7% (on top of the 7% he already had), as well as seats on the board and a five-year contract as CEO, according to the Financial Times. Vivendi said it will not “implement a mandatory squeeze out of Lagardere following its offer, assuming the conditions to do so are met.”

Lagardère’s assets include French radio station Europe 1, magazines such as Journal du Dimanche, Paris Match and leading publishing house Hachette. Its annual revenues reached €4.4 billion in 2020.

Lagardère Studios, the group’s production and distribution banner comprising 27 companies including Spain’s Boomerang, was acquired earlier this year by Mediawan.

Vivendi was the parent company of Universal Music Group for 20 years and now owns 10.13% of UMG. It recently spun off the music powerhouse, giving it a market capitalization close to $52.7 billion and transferred 60% of UMG’s shares into the hands of Vivendi shareholders. Over the past two years, Vivendi sold 20% of UMG to a consortium headed by Chinese entertainment giant Tencent (in two tranches of 10% each) and a further 10% to U.S. hedge fund billionaire William Ackman.",https://www.bing.com/th?id=OVFT.jhzaWf-ObkYeCE9S0pOawi&pid=News%height=394%width=700,2021-12-09T09:13:00,https://variety.com/2021/film/global/vivendi-lagardere-takeover-bid-1235129724/,"Vivendi, the parent company of Canal Plus Group, is set to acquire a 17.5% stake in Lagardere, the French media, publishing and travel retail conglomerate, from Amber Capital in the next few days.","[41, 9, 46]",discuss,"The status of the company was recently changed to “société anonyme” (public limited company) and Arnaud Lagardere obtained an additional 7% (on top of the 7% he already had), as well as seats on the board and a five-year contract as CEO, according to the Financial Times.

But deeper than usual layoffs, in some cases spurred by regulatory crackdowns, are increasingly dimming prospects for young job seekers who already face high unemployment.

Short video app Kuaishou is said to be conducting a new round of layoffs, according to Chinese state media the Paper.cn, which said the cuts are part of the Hong Kong-listed company’s year-end “optimization” mainly aimed at employees who haven’t hit work targets. Overall, around 10% to 30% of the company’s employees could be let go, the report said, citing sources and social media posts from Kuaishou employees. In addition, US-listed streaming platform iQiyi, backed by Chinese search engine giant Baidu, is also reportedly laying off around 20% of its employees, according to finance outlet Caixin.

The layoffs come despite growth in revenues, as firms prepare for a more uncertain future. Kuaishou reported a roughly 33% rise in revenues for the third quarter, as well as a narrowing net loss compared to a year ago. iQiyi, which has around 103 million subscribers, also reported a 6% rise in revenues for the same period, although its net loss has widened.

Meanwhile, new regulations on education have led to more layoffs at ByteDance, the owner of Douyin, TikTok’s Chinese version. The social media firm is said to be laying off around 1,000 employees at its edtech units, after reportedly letting go of thousands of tutoring staff last month and in August. The education industry has been hit hard by China’s crackdown on private tutoring that essentially banned companies from offering such services to students at the ninth grade level or younger.

While it is common for Chinese tech firms to reorganize business lines at the end of each year, the scale of the layoffs this time is broader than in previous years as companies that freely burned cash to grow market share have come under ever greater scrutiny from the Chinese government.

The layoffs are a blow to Chinese workers seeking their first jobs. China’s private tutoring companies used to be seen as a “reservoir” for students just out of university, and the ban on many kinds of tutoring services has already upended millions of lives inside and outside the country. The country’s once lucrative property sector is also struggling, as developers like Evergrande are having issues repaying their debt in the wake of stricter rules around debt for the sector, dimming hopes of landing a job in this field.

In this climate, the number of Chinese youngsters who registered the national exam for selecting government workers exam hit a record high of 2.1 million this year.

Sports,ScienceAndTechnology,"['expected', 'temperature', 'grow', 'sensors', 'market', 'monitoring', 'billion', 'usd', 'cold', 'loggers', 'products', 'chain', 'cagr', 'data', 'report', '47']","Increasing demand of Cold chain monitoring products in the pharmaceuticals & healthcare industry will drive the market. Cold chain monitoring market for transport is expected to grow at highest CAGR during the forecast period

New York, Dec. 09, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Reportlinker.com announces the release of the report ""Cold Chain Monitoring Market with COVID-19 Impact by Offering, Logistics, Application, Temperature And Region - Global Forecast to 2026"" - https://www.reportlinker.com/p04466099/?utm_source=GNW

Transportation is the most important phase in the cold chain due to the possibility of unforeseen environmental variations.Cold chain transportation is a temperature-controlled supply chain used in industries such as pharmaceuticals, healthcare, food & beverages, and chemicals.



The efficient management of cold chain transportation is essential for maintaining the integrity of the products being transported, for instance, the cold chain transportation of pharmaceuticals, many of which must be maintained at a specific temperature.Medical and high-end products have a lower tolerance for temperature excursions, and product spoilage leads to a significant loss of capital.



To minimize the chances of temperature irregularities in transit, transporters use simple measures such as dedicated vehicles, phase-change gel bricks to identify excursions, doubling up on packaging, and active cooling to secure their shipments.



Cold chain monitoring market for hardware segment accounted for the largest share in 2020

Hardware such as sensors, data loggers, RFID devices, and telematics and telemetry devices, and networking devices are used in applications ranging from the sensing of environment to the relaying of data to a centralized database for further evaluation.For most cold chain applications, accuracy and reliability of hardware are critical parameters.



Data loggers are used throughout the cold chain to monitor the temperature of food, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and other temperature-sensitive products.Sensors and data loggers are important components of the sensory network of a cold chain.



Various types of sensors, such as temperature sensors, humidity sensors, chemical indicators, and impact and tilt sensors, are used in this network.Temperature sensors sense the temperature at a specific location within a cold room, freezer room, refrigerator, or freezer unit.



These are generally environmental sensors that measure environmental parameters such as temperature and humidity with more importance given to temperature information. The data from sensors would normally be periodically stored on separate storage elements called data loggers, which could make the necessary data available in readable formats such as PDF files and e-mail. Sensors and data loggers are now being integrated into a single package to form a more compact product.



Americas is expected to hold the largest market for Cold chain monitoring during the forecast period

North America is the largest market for cold chain monitoring in the Americas at present and is likely to exhibit a similar trend during the forecast period.Increasing demand for chilled and frozen food products in North American countries is likely to trigger the demand for cold chain monitoring solutions in the region.



Cold chain monitoring infrastructure includes refrigerated storage and refrigerated transport.The escalating demand for dairy products, vegetables, and fruits is increasing the imports, as well as exports of exotic vegetables and fruits and dairy products, which is also boosting the demand for cold chain monitoring solutions.



According to the United Nations COMTRADE database, in 2012, North America was one of the largest exporters and importers of perishable food, including meat, fish, and seafood, across the world.It was also the largest importer of fruits and vegetables.



The pharmaceutical and healthcare industries also have noteworthy contributions toward the cold chain monitoring market growth in the region. The pharmaceutical industry is subject to stringent regulations aimed at ensuring safety and good storage and distribution practices. Stringent government regulations toward food safety and Global Cold Chain Alliance (GCCA) initiatives help shape the environment in this region, which indirectly impacts the cold chain monitoring market.

38,38,38,39,What counts as a democracy? Biden's summit includes some countries with questionable human rights records,Yahoo! Sports,World,"['democracy', 'countries', 'summit', 'democratic', 'counts', 'questionable', 'russia', 'rights', 'bidens', 'includes', 'records', 'administration', 'freedom', 'biden', 'human']","WASHINGTON — Iraq is home to ""significant human rights issues,"" according to the State Department, such as ""unlawful or arbitrary killings,"" forced disappearances, torture and restrictions on free expression and the press.

In the Democratic Republic of Congo, illegally armed militias recruit children to serve as soldiers, while the government's security forces have committed other abuses.

And the State Department has labeled Pakistan ""a country of particular concern"" under the International Freedom Act for severe violations of freedom of religion. More disturbing: numerous reports of politically motivated killings in Pakistan, an estimated 2,100 political dissenters missing in 2020 and continued ""honor killings"" of Pakistani women despite laws banning the practice.

Despite these questionable human rights records, all three countries will join traditional U.S. allies among the 111 nations in President Joe Biden's inaugural two-day ""Summit for Democracy,"" which kicks off Thursday. At the same time, Hungary, a member of the European Union, and Turkey, a NATO member, were not invited to participate.

Biden organized the virtual summit to rally nations against authoritarianism. Its stated mission is to ""set forth an affirmative agenda for democratic renewal"" and to tackle threats against democracies ""through collective action."" The hope is to kick off a ""year of action"" to strengthen democracies worldwide.

But the invitation list has raised questions – both in Congress and abroad. In a November letter, eight Democratic senators, led by Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Menendez, D-N.J., urged Biden to provide ""more clarity and transparency"" on the criteria for inviting countries.

""Who we invite sends a powerful signal about the values and practices that we believe constitute a democracy,"" the senators wrote. ""While democracies take many forms, and some countries are struggling to consolidate democratic institutions and practices, we must be clear about why we invited each participating government.""

Who's invited to the democracy summit?

The majority of the countries that will take part in the summit – 70 – rank as ""free"" or fully democratic countries, according to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, which used democracy metrics from the nonprofit Freedom House. Another 31 nations are considered ""partly free.""

The CEIP identified eight invitees that fall ""exceptionally low"" on democracy rankings: Angola, Congo, Iraq, Kenya, Malaysia, Pakistan, Serbia and Zambia. And another four have raised ""serious backsliding concerns"" because of autocratic tendencies or declines in freedom of expressions: Brazil, India, the Philippines and Poland.

""If you actually want to spread the democracy idea more globally, you have to bring in more countries,"" said Steven Feldstein, a senior fellow in Carnegie’s Democracy, Conflict, and Governance Program. He said a more limited pool of countries would have made the group overwhelmingly European.

""The downside to that is that you also end up having to make compromises when it comes to certain countries' democratic records. There are a number of countries that raise questions.""

Feldstein said the Biden administration's hope is the summit can be a ""galvanizing event"" that can reverse some of the worst trends in these countries.

Not 'a stamp of approval,' White House says

White House press secretary Jen Psaki addressed concerns about the summit's roster this week, calling the event an opportunity to bring together world leaders from a ""diverse array of experiences"" to strengthen democracy.

""Inclusion or an invitation is not a stamp of approval on their approach to democracy, nor is exclusion a stamp of the opposite of that, of disapproval,"" Psaki said.

Notable – yet expected – omissions from the summit are China and Russia, two American adversaries with histories of human rights violations and ongoing tension with the U.S. Biden announced Monday a diplomatic boycott Monday of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing over its human rights abuses. The administration Tuesday threatened tough economic sanctions against Russia if it continues its aggression against Ukraine.

More: Biden warns Putin of harsh consequences if Russia invades Ukraine

Russia's and China's ambassadors to the U.S. blasted the summit in a joint op-ed last month in National Interest, accusing the U.S. of engaging in ""Cold-War mentality"" by ""empowering itself to define"" who is a ""'democratic country' and who is not eligible for such status.""

""This trend contradicts the development of the modern world,"" the ambassadors wrote. ""It is impossible to prevent the shaping of a global polycentric architecture but could strain the objective process. China and Russia firmly reject this move.""

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban reacts after delivering a speech during an event in Budapest on October 23, to commemorate the 65nd anniversary of Hungarian uprising against Soviet occupation in Budapest on October 23, 2021. - Hungarians took to the streets in separate national day demonstrations to voice support for and against Orban.

Hungary, although an EU member, has limited free speech and other rights under the leadership of far-right Prime Minister Viktor Orban. And while a NATO ally of the U.S., Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has faced allegations of corruption, curbing civil liberties and cracking down on perceived opponents.

""With both countries, you have leaders who have very publicly flouted very core democratic principles,"" Feldstein said, adding that both would have used invitations to the summit to legitimize their leadership before elections next year. ""Ultimately, I don't think there's a lot of justification for including them.""

The criteria for invitees

The White House sought to be ""as inclusive as possible"" with the invitations, according to a senior Biden administration official, to reflect diversity by region, socioeconomic status and experience. The administration also factored in the willingness of a country to contribute to the summit's goals and took the approach that democracy is made up of a country's ""entire society,"" not just its national government.

In countries where democracies are strained, the administrations wants to ""engage them, encourage positive change and learn from the experience,"" the official said.

Norm Eisen, former U.S. ambassador to the Czech Republican in the Obama administration, said, ""Promoting democracy requires unlikely bedfellows."" He said the Biden administration ""struck the right balance because they excluded some of the worst offenders like Hungary, Russia, China, Turkey.""

""You have to send a message that there are limits,"" said Eisen, a senior fellow of governance studies at the Brookings Institution. ""But conversely – places where democracy is on the bubble, where you think you can make progress – you should include.""

In Pakistan, for example, Eisen said the summit can help ""embolden the pro-democracy"" forces."" He said it would be ""a disservice"" not to include Iraq after the years of American bloodshed and massive financial resources that went into democratizing the nation.

An aerial view shows Iraqis, carrying posters of killed anti-government protesters, attend a march to honour the memory of the protesters, killed in protests in 2019, at the Zeitoun bridge, near Habboubi Square in Iraq's southern city of Nasiriyah in Dhi Qar province on November 28, 2021.

The summit is the first of two outings with a second, in-person event in the works for this time in 2022. In addition to government officials, the summit will include leaders from civil society and the private sector.

Ahead of Thursday's summit kickoff, the Biden administration released the first ""strategy on countering corruption."" The Treasury Department is pursuing new real estate rules in the U.S. for greater transparency in hopes of stopping foreign actors from using shell companies to launder money and hide other illicit activity.

In the think tank's updated ""Democracy Playbook,"" the Brookings Institution outlined 10 objectives for the summit to seek. They include commitments to combat corruption, strengthen and ensure election security and voting access, protect the independence of the judiciary, enhance democratic safeguards over technology and promote laws that protect the freedom of press.

But ultimately, whether the summit is successful depends on action, Eisen said, not just commitments.

""We'll be watching what commitments are made, what is the follow through and then evaluating, a year from now, progress. That's what success looks like.""

This comes after the Chelsea man identified 18-year-old Alfie Gilchrist as the 'next John Terry'.

Speaking to caughtoffside.com, Conlon discussed the culture at Chelsea.

When opening up on Chelsea's scouting system, Conlon said: “Even when we won the Champions League you’re getting emails literally the next day being like ‘Guys! Where’s the best six-year-old? We can’t miss out on this player!

“The culture at Chelsea is that we never stand still, we always want to be better.”

The Blues have one of the best scouting systems in the world, leading to Cobham producing elite talent.

Mason Mount, Reece James, Andreas Christensen, Callum Hudson-Odoi and Trevoh Chalobah are all key players in Thomas Tuchel's side, graduating from the Cobham Academy in the last few years.

There are also several other Blues graduates scattered around the Premier League, playing crucial roles for their sides as Cobham dominates the Premier League.

40,40,40,41,Rockets beat shorthanded Nets 114-104 for 7th straight win,CBSSports.com,Sports,"['vs', 'gametracker', 'mathews', 'points', 'nets', 'brooklyn', 'second', 'fourth', 'score', 'rockets', 'game', '2021', 'quarter', 'houston', 'live', 'left', 'stats']","HOUSTON (AP) Eric Gordon scored 21 points before being ejected in the fourth quarter and Garrison Mathews added 19 as the Houston Rockets extended their winning streak to seven games with a 114-104 victory over the shorthanded Brooklyn Nets on Wednesday night.

Before the streak, the Rockets dropped their previous 15 games. It's the first time Houston has won seven straight since winning eight in a row in November 2019.

''The adversity that we went through prior to this point has made it even sweeter,'' coach Stephen Silas said. ''We're feeling pretty good about ourselves.''

James Harden had 25 points for the Eastern Conference-leading Nets on a night when NBA leading scorer Kevin Durant and LaMarcus Aldridge both sat out for rest. It was Harden's second visit to Houston since he was traded in January during his ninth season with the Rockets.

The Rockets led by 17 to start the fourth quarter and the Nets cut the deficit to four before Houston pulled away.

Mathews, who had 12 points in the fourth, scored four in a 5-0 run that extended Houston's lead to 109-97. Patty Mills made one of two free throws for the Nets before a three-point play by D.J. Augustin made it 112-98 with about two minutes to go.

''When you beat a team like that it means something,'' Mathews said. ''This streak's been a huge boost to our confidence. It's been a huge boost to our morale.''

The loss snapped a six-game road winning streak for the Nets, whose nine road wins are tied with the Suns for most in the NBA.

The Nets shot just 8 of 33 from 3-point range, with Harden going 3 of 12 and finishing 4 of 16 overall. He was 14 for 16 from the line.

''I got the shots I wanted, for sure,'' he said. ''I just didn't make them.''

Harden received a fair number of boos when he was introduced and each time he had the ball early. But he got a warm ovation after a highlight video of his time in Houston was played during a timeout in the first quarter.

He formed his hands into the shape of a heart as he held them over his head and then moved them to his chest and smiled as the crowd cheered.

Harden said playing in Houston will always be meaningful to him.

''Very special,'' he said. ''I spent some of my most amazing years here on the court and off the court.''

Cam Thomas had 18 points for Brooklyn, and Mills added 12.

A 10-0 spurt by the Nets got them within four with about 7 1/2 minutes left. Harden capped that run when he made a 3-pointer as he crashed to the court after being fouled by Mathews and made the free throw for a four-point play.

Gordon was ejected soon after that when he received his second technical foul of the game for yelling at the officials about not getting a foul call.

Harden's free throw after Gordon's technical cut the lead to four, but a 6-1 spurt by the Rockets, highlighted by a 3 from Mathews, made it 104-95 with 4 1/2 minutes left.

Houston led by as many as 20 and took control of the game with a 37-point second quarter.

The Rockets ended the third quarter on a 6-2 run, punctuated by a one-handed dunk by Kenyon Martin Jr. to make it 90-73 entering the fourth. Houston rookie Josh Christopher stole the ball from Jevon Carter and dished to Martin on the other end, and he sailed over Carter for the slam.

TIP-INS

Nets: Nic Claxton received a flagrant 1 foul for a foul on Mathews in the second quarter. ... Paul Millsap scored 10 points off the bench. ... Claxton had eight points.

Rockets: Jalen Green missed his sixth straight game with a strained left hamstring. ... Kevin Porter Jr. missed his second game in a row with a bruised left thigh. ... Danuel House sat out with a sprained left ankle.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY

Christopher had a career-high 18 points off the bench on his 20th birthday.

''He's been working at his game day in, day out,'' Silas said. ''He played a really solid game on both ends of the floor.''

Asked what it was like to have such a big game on his birthday, Christopher thought for a second before answering.

''Perfect, perfect day,'' he said.

Nets: Visit the Atlanta Hawks on Friday night.

Rockets: Host the Milwaukee Bucks on Friday night.

Summit for Democracy starts Thursday

President Joe Biden's two-day Summit for Democracy is set to begin Thursday with 111 countries in attendance. Biden organized the virtual summit to rally nations against authoritarianism. Its stated mission is to ""set forth an affirmative agenda for democratic renewal"" and to tackle threats against democracies ""through collective action."" But the invitation list has raised questions – both in Congress and abroad. Countries like Iraq and the Republic of Congo, with questionable human rights records, were invited while Hungary, a member of the European Union, and Turkey, a NATO member, were not invited to participate.

The late Sen. Bob Dole to lie in state in the US Capitol

Memorial events celebrating the late Sen. Bob Dole start Thursday in Washington and end over the weekend in his home state of Kansas. Dole died Sunday morning in his sleep at the age of 98, prompting an outpouring of support and memories from political figures across the country. The former presidential candidate will lie in state Thursday in the U.S. Capitol. President Joe Biden will join Dole's widow, former Sen. Elizabeth Dole, and daughter, Robin, along with congressional leaders at a private ceremony that starts at 10 a.m. ET in the Rotunda. Dole's casket will arrive at the Capitol just before the ceremony and will remain for 24 hours. The Capitol will not be open for public viewing. A funeral service takes place Friday at Washington National Cathedral, with Biden and former presidents expected to attend.

Trial of Kim Potter for death of Daunte Wright to resume in Minneapolis

The manslaughter trial of former Minneapolis police officer Kim Potter will continue Thursday. Jurors heard opening statements from prosecutors and Potter's defense team Wednesday. Prosecutors say Potter committed first- and second-degree manslaughter in the death of Daunte Wright. ""This case is about the defendant, Kim Potter, betraying her oath, betraying her badge, and betraying her trust,"" Prosecutor Erin Eldridge said. Defense attorneys say the shooting was an ""accidental and mistaken discharge,"" according to court filings. ""She made a mistake. This was an accident. She’s a human being. And she had to do what she had to do to prevent a death of a fellow officer,” Potter's defense attorney Paul Engh told jurors.

Cross-country winter snowstorm hits central and western US

A swath of central and western U.S. could see up to 12 inches of snow on Thursday and into Friday, bringing an end to snow dry spells and disrupting travel plans. Parts of Nebraska, Iowa, New Mexico, Wisconsin, South Dakota, Minnesota, and Colorado are under winter storm watches and warnings. The cross-country storm isn't likely to evolve into a bomb cyclone as others have earlier this year, Accuweather reported, but it'll likely be strong enough to bring the first significant snow of the season to western mountain ranges like the Colorado Rockies. For some states, especially those with thriving ski industries, the arrival of snow is highly anticipated and sorely needed.

New 'West Side Story' makes its first appearance in theaters

The second film adaptation of the classic ""Romeo & Juliet""-inspired Broadway musical ""West Side Story"" arrives in theaters for its first showings Thursday night before going wide across the nation Friday. In New York City circa 1957, the white Jets and Puerto Rican Sharks are rival street gangs fighting for what's left of their diminishing turf as slums are cleared and Manhattan's West Side is built up. When ex-Jet Tony (Ansel Elgort) meets and falls in love with Maria (newcomer Rachel Zegler), the sister of the leader of the Sharks, the two meet wherever they can to keep their relationship a secret. In his ★★★½ out of four review, critic Brian Truitt says that Steven Spielberg, the legendary Oscar-winning director, puts his stamp on the movie musical and Tony winner Tony Kushner's new screenplay brings more life to the cast of personalities outside of its young lovers. Truitt adds that Spielberg's take ""doesn't stray too far from the original ... but is rather a more authentic, dynamic and thoughtful revamp.""",https://www.bing.com/th?id=OVFT.2IGN1ozum5pld4vraEk5Ri&pid=News%height=393%width=700,2021-12-09T08:14:00,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/12/09/summit-democracy-bob-dole-memorial-5-things-know-thursday/6432392001/,"President Joe Biden's ""Summit for Democracy is set to begin, Bob Dole will lie in state in the U.S. Capitol and more news to start your Thursday.","[18, 50, 38]",discuss,"The late Sen.

44,44,44,45,Board rules Astroworld lawsuits to be handled by one judge,Houston Chronicle,US,"['request', 'rules', 'board', 'texas', 'handled', 'festival', 'judge', 'lawsuits', 'astroworld', 'asm', 'houston', 'attorneys', 'cases', 'filed']","HOUSTON (AP) — The more than 300 lawsuits that have been filed so far in Houston following a massive crowd surge at the Astroworld festival that left 10 people dead have been consolidated and will be handled by one judge as the cases proceed through the court system, a judicial board ruled.

In an order issued on Tuesday, the Board of Judges of the Civil Trial Division of the Harris County District Courts in Houston granted a request by attorney Brent Coon to have all pretrial matters in the various lawsuits be handled by one judge. If any of the lawsuits go to trial, the case would return to its original court.

“This consolidation will promote the expeditious and efficient administration of justice,” the two-page order said.

All pretrial motions and issues in the lawsuits will be heard by state District Judge Kristen Hawkins.

Those who have been sued include rap superstar Travis Scott, who created the festival and was the headliner, concert promoter Live Nation and other companies connected to the event.

The 10 people who died were among 50,000 who had attended the festival and were in the audience on Nov. 5 when Scott’s concert turned deadly as fans surged toward the stage during his set.

The youngest victim was 9-year-old Ezra Blount. The others who died ranged in age from 14 to 27. Some 300 people were injured and treated at the festival site and 25 were taken to hospitals.

Coon, who is representing about 2,000 concertgoers and is asking for $10 billion in damages, made his consolidation request last month. He said Wednesday that having all the cases before one judge will create efficiency, eliminate redundancy and spread costs in the cases to everyone involved in the litigation.

“You don’t want to have all the same issues argued and all the same witnesses deposed over and over again in every courtroom,” Coon said.

But the consolidation that was granted on Tuesday might conflict with a similar request made by lawyers for ASM Global Parent, Inc. and its subsidiaries, which manage events at NRG Park, where the Astroworld festival was held.

Lawyers for ASM Global have also asked in a motion filed with the Texas Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation, which is overseen by the Texas Supreme Court, to consolidate the lawsuits but assign them to a different Harris County judge, Lauren Reeder.

“Counsel representing more than 2,500 plaintiffs or potential plaintiffs and all principal defendants have agreed to this motion,” ASM Global’s attorneys said in their motion, which was filed on Dec. 1.

ASM Global’s attorneys have asked that all discovery in the lawsuits — when attorneys can request or obtain documents or other information or depose witnesses — be halted until the state panel issues a ruling.

Attorneys for ASM Global didn’t immediately return emails on Wednesday seeking comment.

Coon said he believes the company's request is no longer needed. If the state panel were to issue a decision, it would overrule the local order.

“Harris County has already addressed that with this order. So, if the (Texas) Supreme Court did anything now, they would just be meddling,” Coon said.

Earlier this week, Scott's attorneys also filed his first response to several of the lawsuits, denying the accusations against him and asking that the cases be dismissed.

Coon said Scott’s denial of the accusations and his request for dismissal are standard in such lawsuits and similar to an individual entering a not guilty plea at the start of a criminal case.

Scott and the event organizers are the focus of a criminal investigation by Houston police. No one has been charged, and no timetable has been set for when the investigation would be completed.

Scott’s attorney had previously reached out to the families of the 10 who died, offering to pay for their loved ones’ funeral costs. Several of the families turned down the offer.

The swimmer was able to remove the woman from the car in the dangerous mission. The woman, a local resident who was in her 60s whose identity has not been released, did not survive, according to the Associated Press.

Authorities are now trying to figure out how the car ended up in the river about 50 yards from the top of the American Falls. The car was spotted floating down the river near a pedestrian bridge just before noon, WKBW Channel 7 reports.

Police say the vehicle entered the river between the pedestrian bridge and a vehicle bridge. There was no one else in the car, according to the Buffalo News.

The car reportedly was still in the river Wednesday evening as officials tried to figure out the safest way to remove it.

Meanwhile, the rescue effort by Petty Officer 2nd Class Derrian Duryea and the helicopter crew, pilot Lt. Chris Monacelli and flight mechanic Jon Finnerty, is drawing worldwide attention, reports say. All had to endure dangerous conditions ... Duryea with the currents and cold water, and the crew with concerns about icing on the aircraft as it hovered about 80 feet above the water.

“As I was coming down I was just really focused on how am I going to get in this car when there’s, you know, pretty much rapids coming over the car right next to Niagara Falls,” Duryea tells the AP. “My sole focus was which window or door am I going in.”

“Luckily, the car was unlocked and I didn’t have to break out any windows and I was able to open up the passenger side door and push it up against the current.”

Monacelli tells the AP that ice buildup on the helicopter from the mist of the river limited his visibility during the rescue operation.

“A lot of bigger planes have deicing capabilities, but we don’t,” Monacelli said. “We have a lot of discussions and training for what we’d do if we got into that situation because if you do accumulate enough ice on the helicopter, it will fall out of the sky.”

New York Park Police Capt. Christopher Rola said his department’s swift-water rescue teams were unable to get to the car because of its location.

The new round comes from EQT Growth and values the 10-year-old business at $5.5 billion.

Check out the pitch deck Mambu used to raise its second funding round of 2021.

Cloud banking startup Mambu has raised its second funding round of the year, more than doubling its valuation in the process to $5.5 billion.

The Berlin-based company, which was founded in 2011, has developed a platform that can help wean traditional banks off their legacy tech stacks and enable fintechs to offer fully cloud-based banking services.

The market for cloud-based banking infrastructure is booming as financial institutions aim to offer more customized products such as personal or business loans to customers with greater ease and at a lower cost.

""The market is large but more of it is embracing this new model and it's growing by leaps and bounds every year,"" Eugene Danilkis, Mambu CEO, told Insider.

""Three or four years ago players weren't talking about cloud, now it's a given for the industry as companies now realize it's about having tech that enables you to have a new operating model which is more like a tech company.""

Mambu has brought in $266 million from EQT Growth to continue fuelling its product and geographic growth. The German startup previously raised $135 million in January 2021 from Tiger Global. Danilkis added the company had more than doubled in value since its Series D round at the start of the year, when it was worth $2.1 billion.

German neobank N26, British lending platform OakNorth, Orange, and Santander, are among Mambu's customers. The company claims to have added around 40 new clients this year.

Danilkis said the company is still on track to increase its headcount to more than 1,000 people by next year with around 800 staff at the startup now. The funding will go towards further development of the company's commercial and engineering teams across key markets like the US and Latin America with new products and services set to be announced.

Much of the anticipated product growth will come in the form of deepened integrations with third-party companies via APIs to offer a greater number of services to clients with improved accessibility.

Mambu began considering a new funding round during the summer and opted to work with EQT Growth having held conversations during the company's last round, Danilkis said.

""Our current focus is on growth, not profitability,"" he added. ""We believe we are allocating capital in a sustainable way to help us grow by not throwing good money after bad which is keeping our margins strong.""

The proposal, a global first that needs to be thrashed out with EU countries and EU lawmakers before it can become law, marks the latest attempt by the European Union to regulate tech companies and ensure a level playing field.

Online platform companies that set pay and standards of conduct for their workers will have to classify them as employees entitled to a minimum wage, paid holidays and pension rights, according to the draft rules.

The companies will also be considered an employer if they supervise the performance of work through electronic means, restrict workers' ability to choose their working hours or tasks, and prevent them from working for third parties.

The rules will also require ride-hailing, food delivery apps and other companies to be more transparent on how they use algorithms to monitor and evaluate workers and to set tasks and fees. Employees can ask for compensation for breaches.

The EU executive said the draft rules could apply to between 1.7 million and 4.1 million workers from the 28 million working at more than 500 online platform companies across the 27-country bloc.

""Genuine self-employed on platforms will be protected through enhanced legal certainty on their status and there will be new safeguards against the pitfalls of algorithmic management.

More than a dozen organizations are volunteering their time and/or services for the event.

""It’s amazing how it’s coming together,"" Watson said by phone Tuesday.

He said it started with VITAS Healthcare wanting to make donations with veterans in mind, and as word spread, more organizations wanted to participate.

The list so far includes: Volusia County Veterans Services; Volusia County Health Department; VITAS Healthcare; CareerSource Flagler Volusia; Daytona State College; Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University; Veterans Court representatives, a specialist from the Veterans Justice Outreach Program; Daytona Beach Vet Center; Changing Homelessness; Supportive Services for Veteran Families; Sherry and Tim's House of Hope; CarePlus Health Plans; WNDB; and Team Red, White & Blue.

Ray Allen, Volusia County's veterans services counselor, looks through donations collected for the stand down event coming to Daytona Beach. Veterans in need and their families may get free clothing, toiletries and other items during the event on Tuesday, Dec. 14.

Watson said he hopes to make the stand-down an annual event in Volusia County based on how many organizations offered to help.

Story continues

During the coronavirus pandemic, veterans, just like so many others, experienced hardship.

But difficulties related to employment aren't new for veterans, Watson said.

""The biggest portion of our military is infantry, and those jobs don’t cross over to a whole lot of occupations in the civilian community, so that’s part of this too,"" Watson said.

What is a 'stand-down?'

In times of war, a stand-down was when ""exhausted combat units requiring time to rest and recover were removed from the battlefields to a place of relative security and safety,"" according to the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans.

50,50,50,51,Biden to decry democracy 'recession' at White House summit,SFGate,US,"['democracy', 'countries', 'house', 'summit', 'decry', 'democratic', 'president', 'rights', 'administration', 'recession', 'report', 'biden', 'white']","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden is ready to urge participants at the first White House Summit for Democracy to reverse an ongoing “recession” of democracy that is playing out at a time of rising authoritarianism around the globe and extraordinary strains on foundational institutions in the U.S.

The two-day virtual summit that starts Thursday has been billed as an opportunity for leaders and civil society experts from some 110 countries to collaborate on fighting corruption and promoting respect for human rights. But the gathering already has drawn backlash from the United States' chief adversaries and other nations that were not invited to participate.

The ambassadors to the U.S. from China and Russia wrote a joint essay in the National Interest policy journal describing the Biden administration as exhibiting a “Cold-War mentality"" that will “stoke up ideological confrontation and a rift in the world."" The administration has also faced scrutiny over how it went about deciding which countries to invite.

The Biden administration, for its part, says the virtual gathering is a critical meeting at a moment when a profound diminishment of freedoms is trending around the globe. Biden has said that confronting that dynamic is “the challenge of our time.”

White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden, who is scheduled to address the summit at its opening Thursday and again Friday, will call on participants to dedicate themselves to “reversing the democratic recession and ensuring that democracies deliver for their people.""

Biden also plans to speak about the importance of voting rights at home, much as he did at an anniversary celebration of the capital’s Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial, according to a senior administration official who previewed the event for reporters on the condition of anonymity. At the time, the Democratic president called voting a “fundamental right” and decried efforts to curtail it as “the most un-American thing” imaginable.

The summit comes as U.S. democracy faces grave challenges to its institutions and traditions.

Local elected officials are resigning at an alarming rate amid confrontations with angry voices at school board meetings, elections offices and town halls. States are passing laws to limit access to the ballot, making it more difficult for Americans to vote. And the Jan. 6 attack at the Capitol has left many in one U.S. political party clinging to Donald Trump’s false claims of a stolen election, eroding trust in the accuracy of the vote.

Biden has said passage of his ambitious domestic agenda — the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill he signed into law, as well as the roughly $2 trillion “Build Back Better Act” of social and climate change initiatives moving through the Senate — will demonstrate how democracy can improve people’s lives.

Some advocates also want Biden to focus on other ways to shore up democracy at home. One early test will come Thursday as the House moves to approve the Protecting Our Democracy Act, the third in a trio of bills — alongside the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act — largely backed by Democrats in Congress but stalled by Republicans in the Senate.

“The United States has a thriving democracy, but it’s been hurting in recent years,” said Michael Abramowitz, the president of Freedom House, whose annual report marked a 15th consecutive year of a global democratic slide. “Right now, we’re going through a phase in America where it’s very difficult to get things done and to really prove that democracy can deliver.""

Biden has made promoting democratic values a focal point of his foreign policy and has repeatedly stressed the need for the U.S. and other like-minded allies to demonstrate that democracies are a better vehicle for societies than autocracies.

But over the first year of his presidency, democratic freedoms have continued to erode.

In its new annual report released Wednesday, CIVICUS Monitor, a global rights index, said 13 countries saw their civic freedoms downgraded in 2021 from the previous year. Only one, Mongolia, saw civic freedoms improve, according to the report. Of the 197 countries graded by the group, only 39 were rated as open societies.

A Pew Research Center report released this week said that while “people like democracy, their commitment to it is often not very strong.” Even wealthy countries, including the U.S., have some people who favor military rule, the report said.

Another group, the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, said in its annual report that the number of countries experiencing democratic backsliding “has never been as high” as the past decade, with the U.S. added to the list alongside India and Brazil.

Chinese officials have offered a stream of public criticism about the summit, with one senior government official even calling it a “joke."" They have also expressed outrage over the administration inviting Taiwan to take part in the gathering. China claims the self-governing island as part of its territory and objects to it having any contact on its own with foreign governments.

“The U.S. side claims that its so-called democracy summit is to defend democracy, then I can’t help asking with the most abundant and advanced medical resources and technology, how could the U.S. allow more than 800,000 of its people to die from the virus and leave nearly 50 million people suffering the COVID still?"" China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said this week. ""With such human rights tragedies, how can the U.S. defend democracy?”

Other uninvited countries have shown their displeasure. Hungary, the only European Union member not invited, tried to block EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen from speaking on behalf of the bloc at the summit. During the 2020 campaign, Biden referred to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban as a “thug.”

The White House declined to say how it went about deciding who was invited and who was left off the list.

For example, Turkey, a fellow NATO member, and Egypt, a key U.S. ally in the Middle East, were also left off. The Biden administration has raised human rights concerns about both nations. However, Poland, which has faced criticism for undermining the independence of its judiciary and media, was invited.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the invitation list was not meant to be a “stamp of approval or disapproval.”

“It’s just meant to have a diverse range of voices and faces and representatives at the discussion,” she said.

Senate votes to repeal Biden federal vaccine mandate for businesses

The Senate voted Wednesday to repeal a President Biden -backed federal COVID-19 vaccine mandate for private businesses.

The final vote was 52-48. Moderate Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Jon Tester of Montana joined Republicans to vote in favor of the repeal.

Republicans brought the repeal to the Senate floor under the ""Congressional Review Act,"" which allows Congress to review presidential executive orders. Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind., who sponsored the resolution, said the mandate was an example of the ""heavy hand of government"" hurting businesses.

The Biden administration’s mandate requires private companies with 100 or more employees to ensure their employees are vaccinated against COVID-19 or undergo regular testing. Firms that do not comply face steep fines.

The mandate prompted immediate legal challenges from several states as well as business and religious groups. Last month, a federal appeals court enacted a temporary hold on enforcement of the mandate pending the outcome of litigation.

Even with Senate approval, the GOP-backed resolution is unlikely to overturn the mandate. The Democrat-controlled House is not expected to take up the measure and President Biden would likely veto the bill if it cleared Congress. CLICK HERE FOR MORE ON OUR TOP STORY.

Los Angeles County DA blasted over 'tone deaf' news conference on crime: ‘An embarrassment’

Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascon was surrounded by several colleagues from other states Wednesday while defending his policies amid a second recall attempt to oust him and a crime wave of shootings and brazen burglaries.

Gascon, a former San Francisco police chief, has taken heat since taking office last year over his rollback of tough-on-crime measures like the death penalty, charging juvenile suspects as adults and the leveling of criminal enhancements, which can significantly increase prison sentences.

""We have set a path for ourselves and turned around the criminal legal system in the country in a way that will be more humane, more equitable and, above all, will create a safer environment for all of us,"" he claimed during a news conference.

""Before I took office, the legal system here offered victims one solution after someone causes harm: a long sentence,"" Gascon continued. ""We operated towards victims like a factory making widgets.""

Gascon's most ardent critics include Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva, some of his own prosecutors , and crime victims who accuse him of abandoning his responsibility to prosecute criminals.

""That press conference was an embarrassment. George Gascon is completely tone-deaf to the impact his policies are having on victims and public safety,"" said Desiree Andrade, co-chair of the Recall DA George Gascon campaign. CLICK HERE FOR MORE.

Jussie Smollett’s fate rests with jury as trial draws to a close

The jury at Jussie Smollett ’s trial on allegations he staged an elaborate hate crime against himself heard closing arguments Wednesday from both the actor's defense team and from prosecutors before beginning their deliberations.

Neither side held back from making key points about Smollett’s alleged involvement in what prosecutors now believe was a hate-crime hoax orchestrated by the former ""Empire"" actor – and carried out by their star witnesses, brothers Abimbola and Olabingo Osundairo, who testified Smollett paid them $3,500 to participate in the alleged scheme in January 2019.

The lawyers' closing arguments capped just over one week of testimony in the case. The jury deliberated for about two hours Wednesday but failed to reach a verdict. They were expected to resume deliberations Thursday as long as all 12 jurors arrive at court by 10:15 a.m. ET.

On Wednesday, the jurors asked the court, ""Can we have a copy of the calendar of events?"" There had been a display on a screen showing the month of January 2019 with specific dates marked off by prosecutors listing what happened on those days.

In his closing, special prosecutor Dan Webb said Smollett caused Chicago police to spend enormous resources investigating an alleged crime that they now believe is fake. Smollett, who is Black and gay, told police someone put a noose around his neck and yelled racist and homophobic slurs during the alleged attack near his downtown Chicago home.

Defense attorney Nenye Uche called the Osundairo brothers ""sophisticated liars"" who were out for money. CLICK HERE FOR MORE.

U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., sounded the alarm Wednesday night on what he claimed was the growing ""control"" China has over American corporations .

""There's evidence up here that's pretty clear is how dependent our economy has become on China,"" Rubio argued on ""Special Report."" ""When I say ‘our economy,’ it's the things we buy at stores, but it's also our corporations. I mean, we've got large, very influential, powerful organizations in our country and the business sector who rely on the access to the Chinese market and production in China for their bottom line. … It is for them too valuable now to jeopardize.""

Tight end Gavin Reinwald became the third Cal player this week to declare his plans to depart by entering the transfer portal.

A fifth-year senior from Elk Grove, Reinwald played in all 12 games this season. He caught just four passes for 55 yards, but two of his receptions went for touchdowns.

Running back Christopher Brooks and defensive end JH Tevis entered the transfer portal earlier this week. But while both Brooks and Tevis were starters whose exit will be felt, Reinwald was a reserve in a deep room of tight ends.

Two promising freshmen, Keleki Latu and Jermaine Terry II, are expected to take on expanded roles next season. Elijah Mojarro, Nick Alftin and Jake Muller are also eligible to return while starter Jake Tonges will decide whether to use the NCAA’s COVID exemption to play a final season after catching 22 passes for 278 yards and two touchdowns.

Reinwald played 41 games for the Bears, catching 31 passes for 315 yards and four touchdowns over five seasons.
